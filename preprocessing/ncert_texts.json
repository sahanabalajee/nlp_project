The actual event most \nprobably took place in Robert Clive’s tent, with a few Englishmen \nand Indians as witnesses. But in the painting above, the event \nis shown as a majestic occasion, taking place in a grand setting. \nThe painter was commissioned by Clive to record the memorable \nevents in Clive’s life. The grant of Diwani clearly was one such \nevent in British imagination.\nAs Diwan, the Company became the chief financial \nadministrator of the territory under its control. Now it had to think \nof administering the land and organising its revenue resources. \nThis had to be done in a way that could yield enough revenue to \nmeet the growing expenses of the company. A trading company \nhad also to ensure that it could buy the products it needed and \nsell what it wanted. \nRuling the Countryside                   \n3\nReprint 2024-25\n\t\nRULING THE COUNTRYSIDE          27\nOver the years, the Company also learnt that it had to \nmove with some caution. Being an alien power, it needed \nto pacify those who in the past had ruled the countryside, \nand enjoyed authority and prestige. Those who had held \nlocal power had to be controlled but they could not be \nentirely eliminated.\nHow was this to be done? In this chapter we will see how the \nCompany came to colonise the countryside, organise revenue \nresources, redefine the rights of people, and produce the crops \nit wanted.\nRevenue for the Company\nThe Company had become the Diwan, but it still saw itself \nprimarily as a trader. It wanted a large revenue income but \nwas unwilling to set up any regular system of assessment and \ncollection. The effort was to increase the revenue as much as it \ncould and buy fine cotton and silk cloth as cheaply as possible. \nWithin five years, the value of goods bought by the Company \nin Bengal doubled. Before 1765, the Company had purchased \ngoods in India by importing gold and silver from Britain. Now \nthe revenue collected in Bengal could finance the purchase of \ngoods for export. \nSoon it was clear that the Bengal economy was facing a deep \ncrisis. Artisans were deserting villages since they were being \nforced to sell their goods to the Company at low prices. Peasants \nwere unable to pay the dues that were being demanded from them. \nArtisanal production was in decline, and agricultural cultivation \nshowed signs of collapse. Then in 1770, a terrible famine killed \nten million people in Bengal. About one-third of the population \nwas wiped out.\nFig. 2 – A weekly market \nin Murshidabad in Bengal\nPeasants and artisans \nfrom rural areas regularly \ncame to these weekly \nmarkets (haats) to sell \ntheir goods and buy what \nthey needed. These markets \nwere badly affected during \ntimes of economic crisis.\nReprint 2024-25\n28\t\nOUR PASTS – III\nThe need to improve agriculture\nIf the economy was in ruins, could the Company be certain \nof its revenue income? Most Company officials began to \nfeel that investment in land had to be encouraged and \nagriculture had to be improved. \nHow was this to be done? After two decades of debate \non the question, the Company finally introduced the \nPermanent Settlement in 1793. By the terms of the \nsettlement, the rajas and taluqdars were recognised \nas zamindars. They were asked to collect rent from the \npeasants and pay revenue to the Company. The amount \nto be paid was fixed permanently, that is, it was not to be \nincreased ever in future. It was felt that this would ensure \na regular flow of revenue into the Company’s coffers and \nat the same time encourage the zamindars to invest in \nimproving the land. Since the revenue demand of the state \nwould not be increased, the zamindar would benefit from \nincreased production from the land. \nThe problem\nThe Permanent Settlement, however, created problems. \nCompany officials soon discovered that the zamindars \nwere in fact not investing in the improvement of land. \nThe revenue that had been fixed was so high that the \nzamindars found it difficult to pay. Anyone who failed \nto pay the revenue lost his zamindari. Numerous \nzamindaris were sold off at auctions organised by  \nthe Company.\nBy the first decade of the nineteenth century, the \nsituation changed. The prices in the market rose and \ncultivation slowly expanded. This meant an increase in \nthe income of the zamindars but no gain for the Company \nsince it could not increase a revenue demand that had \nbeen fixed permanently.\nEven then the zamindars did not have an interest \nin improving the land. Some had lost their lands in \nthe earlier years of the settlement; others now saw the \npossibility of earning without the trouble and risk of \ninvestment. As long as the zamindars could give out the \nland to tenants and get rent, they were not interested in \nimproving the land. \nFig. 3 – Charles Cornwallis \nCornwallis was the Governor-\nGeneral of Bengal when the \nPermanent Settlement was \nintroduced.\nColebrook on \nBengal ryots\nIn many villages of  \nBengal, some of the \npowerful ryots did not \ncultivate, but instead gave \nout their lands to others (the \nunder-tenants), taking \nfrom them very high \nrents. In 1806, H. T. \nColebrook described \nthe conditions of these \nunder-tenants in Bengal:\nThe \nunder-tenants, \ndepressed \nby \nan \nexcessive \nrent \nin \nkind, and by usurious \nreturns for the cattle, \nseed, and subsistence, \nadvanced to them, \ncan never extricate \nthemselves \nfrom \ndebt. In so abject a \nstate, \nthey \ncannot \nlabour in spirit, while \nthey earn a scanty \nsubsistence \nwithout \nhope \nof \nbettering \ntheir situation. \nActivity\n\nWhy do you think Colebrook is concerned with the \nconditions of the under-ryots in Bengal? Read the \npreceding pages and suggest possible reasons. \nSource 1\nReprint 2024-25\n\t\nRULING THE COUNTRYSIDE          29\nOn the other hand, in the villages, the cultivator \nfound the system extremely oppressive. The rent he paid \nto the zamindar was high and his right on the land was \ninsecure. To pay the rent he had to often take a loan \nfrom the moneylender, and when he failed to pay the \nrent, he was evicted from the land he had cultivated \nfor generations. \nA new system is devised\nBy the early nineteenth century, many of the Company \nofficials were convinced that the system of revenue \nhad to be changed again. How could revenues be fixed \npermanently at a time when the Company needed \nmore money to meet its expenses of administration \nand trade? \nIn the North Western Provinces of the Bengal \nPresidency (most of this area is now in Uttar Pradesh), \nan Englishman called Holt Mackenzie devised the \nnew system which came into effect in 1822. He felt \nthat the village was an important social institution \nin north Indian society and needed to be preserved. \nUnder his directions, collectors went from village to \nvillage, inspecting the land, measuring the fields, \nand recording the customs and rights of different \ngroups. The estimated revenue of each plot within a \nvillage was added up to calculate the revenue that \neach  village (mahal) had to pay. This demand  was \nto be revised periodically, not permanently fixed. The \ncharge of collecting the revenue and paying it to the \nCompany was given to the village headman, rather \nthan the zamindar. This system came to be known as \nthe mahalwari settlement.\nThe Munro system\nIn the British territories in the South, there was a similar \nmove away from the idea of Permanent Settlement. The \nnew system that was devised came to be known as the \nryotwar (or ryotwari ). It was tried on a small scale by \nCaptain Alexander Read in some of the areas that were \ntaken over by the Company after the wars with Tipu Sultan. \nSubsequently developed by Thomas Munro, this system \nwas gradually extended all over south India.\nRead and Munro felt that in the south there were \nno traditional zamindars. The settlement, they argued, \nhad to be made directly with the cultivators (ryots) who \nhad tilled the land for generations. Their fields had to \nbe carefully and separately surveyed before the revenue \nassessment was made. Munro thought that the British \nMahal – In British \nrevenue records, mahal \nis a revenue estate which \nmay be a village or a \ngroup of villages.\nFig. 4 – Thomas Munro, Governor \nof Madras (1819 –26) \nReprint 2024-25\n30\t\nOUR PASTS – III\nshould act as paternal father figures protecting the \nryots under their charge.\nAll was not well\nWithin a few years after the new systems were imposed, \nit was clear that all was not well with them. Driven by \nthe desire to increase the income from land, revenue \nofficials fixed too high a revenue demand. Peasants were \nunable to pay, ryots fled the countryside, and villages \nbecame deserted in many regions. Optimistic officials \nhad imagined that the new systems would transform \nthe peasants into rich enterprising farmers. But this \ndid not happen. \nCrops for Europe\nThe British also realised that the countryside could \nnot only yield revenue, it could also grow the crops \nthat Europe required. By the late eighteenth century, \nthe Company was trying its best to expand the \ncultivation of opium and indigo. In the century and \na half that followed, the British persuaded or forced \ncultivators in various parts of India to produce other \ncrops: jute in Bengal, tea in Assam, sugarcane in \nthe United Provinces (now Uttar Pradesh), wheat \nin Punjab, cotton in Maharashtra and Punjab, rice \nin Madras.\nHow was this done? The British used a variety of methods \nto expand the cultivation of crops that they needed. Let us \ntake a closer look at the story of one such crop, one such \nmethod of production.\nDoes colour have a \nhistory?\nFigs. 5 and 6 are two \nimages of cotton prints. \nThe image on the left \n(Fig. 5) shows a kalamkari \nprint created by weavers \nof Andhra Pradesh in \nIndia. On the right is \na floral cotton print \ndesigned and produced \nby William Morris, a \nfamous poet and artist \nof nineteenth-century \nBritain.

Do you know how this colour was produced?\nThe blue that you see in these prints was produced \nfrom a plant called indigo. It is likely that the blue dye \nused in the Morris prints in nineteenth-century Britain \nwas manufactured from indigo plants cultivated in India. \nFor India was the biggest supplier of indigo in the world at \nthat time. \nWhy the demand for Indian indigo?\nThe indigo plant grows primarily in the tropics. By the \nthirteenth century, Indian indigo was being used by cloth \nmanufacturers in Italy, France and Britain to dye cloth.\nHowever, only small amounts of Indian indigo reached \nthe European market and its price was very high. \nEuropean cloth manufacturers therefore had to depend \non another plant called woad to make violet and blue \ndyes. Being a plant of the temperate zones, woad was \nmore easily available in Europe. It was grown in northern \nItaly, southern France and in parts of Germany and \nBritain. Worried by the competition from indigo, woad \nproducers in Europe pressurised their governments to \nban the import of indigo.\nCloth dyers, however, preferred indigo as a dye. Indigo \nproduced a rich blue colour, whereas the dye from woad \nwas pale and dull. By the seventeenth century, European \ncloth producers persuaded their governments to relax the \nban on indigo import. The French began cultivating indigo \nin St Domingue in the Caribbean islands, the Portuguese \nin Brazil, the English in Jamaica, and the Spanish in \nVenezuela. Indigo plantations also came up in many parts \nof North America.\nBy the end of the eighteenth century, the demand for \nIndian indigo grew further. Britain began to industrialise, \nand its cotton production expanded dramatically, creating \nan enormous new demand for cloth dyes. While the demand \nfor indigo increased, its existing supplies from the West \nIndies and America collapsed for a variety of reasons. \nBetween 1783 and 1789, the production of indigo in the \nworld fell by half. Cloth dyers in Britain now desperately \nlooked for new sources of indigo supply. \nFrom where could this indigo be procured? \nBritain turns to India\nFaced with the rising demand for indigo in Europe, the \nCompany in India looked for ways to expand the area under \nindigo cultivation. \nPlantation – A large \nfarm operated by a \nplanter employing \nvarious forms of \nforced labour. \nPlantations are \nassociated with the \nproduction of coffee, \nsugarcane, tobacco, \ntea and cotton. \nReprint 2024-25\n32\t\nOUR PASTS – III\nFrom the last decades \nof the eighteenth century, \nindigo cultivation in \nBengal expanded rapidly \nand Bengal indigo came to \ndominate the world market. \nIn 1788, only about 30 per \ncent of the indigo imported \ninto Britain was from India. \nBy 1810, the proportion had \ngone up to 95 per cent.\nAs the indigo trade \ngrew, commercial agents \na n d  o f f i c i a l s  o f  t h e \nCompany began investing \nin indigo production. Over \nthe years many Company \nofficials left their jobs \nto look after their indigo \nbusiness. Attracted by \nthe prospect of high profits, numerous Scotsmen and \nEnglishmen came to India and became planters. Those \nwho had no money to produce indigo could get loans \nfrom the Company and the banks that were coming up \nat the time.\nHow was indigo cultivated? \nThere were two main systems of indigo cultivation – nij \nand ryoti. Within the system of nij cultivation, the planter \nproduced indigo in lands that he directly controlled. \nHe either bought the land or rented it from other \nzamindars and produced indigo by directly employing \nhired labourers. \nThe problem with nij cultivation\nThe planters found it difficult to expand the area under \nnij cultivation. Indigo could be cultivated only on fertile \nlands, and these were all already densely populated. Only \nsmall plots scattered over the landscape could be acquired. \nPlanters needed large areas in compact blocks to cultivate \nindigo in plantations. Where could they get such land \nfrom? They attempted to lease in the land around the \nindigo factory, and evict the peasants from the area. But \nthis always led to conflicts and tension. \nNor was labour easy to mobilise. A large plantation \nrequired a vast number of hands to operate. And labour \nwas needed precisely at a time when peasants were usually \nbusy with their rice cultivation. \nFig. 7 – The Slave Revolt in               \nSt Domingue, August 1791,  \npainting by January Scuhodolski\nIn the eighteenth century, French \nplanters produced indigo and \nsugar in the French colony of \nSt Domingue in the Caribbean \nislands. The African slaves who \nworked on the plantations rose \nin rebellion in 1791, burning \nthe plantations and killing their \nrich planters. In 1792, France \nabolished slavery in the French \ncolonies. These events led to the \ncollapse of the indigo plantations \non the Caribbean islands.\nSlave – A person who is \nowned by someone else – \nthe slave owner. A slave \nhas no freedom and is \ncompelled to work for the \nmaster. \nReprint 2024-25\n\t\nRULING THE COUNTRYSIDE          33\nNij cultivation on a large scale also required many \nploughs and bullocks. One bigha of indigo cultivation \nrequired two ploughs. This meant that a planter with \n1,000 bighas would need 2,000 ploughs. Investing \non purchase and maintenance of ploughs was a big \nproblem. Nor could supplies be easily got from the \npeasants since their ploughs and bullocks were busy \non their rice fields, again exactly at the time that the \nindigo planters needed them. \nTill the late nineteenth century, planters were therefore \nreluctant to expand the area under nij cultivation. Less \nthan 25 per cent of the land producing indigo was under \nthis system. The rest was under an alternative mode of \ncultivation – the ryoti system.\nIndigo on the land of ryots\nUnder the ryoti system, the planters \nforced the ryots to sign a contract, \nan agreement (satta). At times \nthey pressurised the village \nheadmen to sign the contract on \nbehalf of the ryots. Those who \nsigned the contract got cash \nadvances from the planters at \nlow rates of interest to produce \nindigo. But the loan committed \nthe ryot to cultivating indigo on at \nleast 25 per cent of the area under \nhis holding. The planter provided \nthe seed and the drill, while the \ncultivators prepared the soil, sowed \nthe seed and looked after the crop. \nFig. 8 – Workers harvesting \nindigo in early-nineteenth-century \nBengal.

After harvest, the indigo plant was taken to the vats in \nthe indigo factory. Three or four vats were needed to manufacture \nthe dye. Each vat had a separate function. The leaves stripped off \nthe indigo plant were first soaked in warm water in a vat (known \nas the fermenting or steeper vat) for several hours. When the \nplants fermented, the liquid began to boil and bubble. Now the \nrotten leaves were taken out and the liquid drained into another \nvat that was placed just below the first vat. \nIn the second vat (known as the beater vat), the solution was \ncontinuously stirred and beaten with paddles. When the liquid \ngradually turned green and then blue, lime water was added to \nthe vat. Gradually the indigo separated out in flakes, a muddy \nsediment settled at the bottom of the vat and a clear liquid rose \nto the surface. The liquid was drained off and the sediment – \nthe indigo pulp – transferred to \nanother vat (known as the \nsettling vat), and then \npressed and dried for \nsale. \nFermenting \nVat\nBeater \nVat\nHow was indigo produced?\nReprint 2024-25\n\t\nRULING THE COUNTRYSIDE          35\nWhen the crop was delivered to the planter after the \nharvest, a new loan was given to the ryot, and the cycle \nstarted all over again. Peasants who were initially tempted \nby the loans soon realised how harsh the system was. The \nprice they got for the indigo they produced was very low \nand the cycle of loans never ended.\nThere were other problems too. The planters usually \ninsisted that indigo be cultivated on the best soils in \nwhich peasants preferred to cultivate rice. Indigo, \nmoreover, had deep roots and it exhausted the soil \nrapidly. After an indigo harvest the land could not be \nsown with rice. \nThe “Blue Rebellion” and After\nIn March 1859, thousands of ryots in Bengal refused \nto grow indigo. As the rebellion spread, ryots refused \nto pay rents to the planters, and attacked indigo \nfactories armed with swords and spears, bows and \narrows. Women turned up to fight with pots, pans \nand kitchen implements. Those who worked for the \nplanters were socially boycotted, and the gomasthas – \nagents of planters – who came to collect rent were \nbeaten up. Ryots swore they would no longer take \nadvances to sow indigo nor be bullied by the planters’ \nlathiyals – the lathi-wielding strongmen maintained by \nthe planters.\nWhy did the indigo peasants decide that they would no \nlonger remain silent? What gave them the power to rebel? \nClearly, the indigo system was intensely oppressive. But \nthose who are oppressed do not always rise up in rebellion. \nThey do so only at times. \nIn 1859, the indigo ryots felt that they had the  support \nof the local zamindars and village headmen in their \nrebellion against the planters. In many villages, headmen \nwho had been forced to sign indigo contracts, mobilised \nthe indigo peasants and fought pitched battles with the \nlathiyals. In other places even the zamindars went around \nvillages urging the ryots to resist the planters. These \nzamindars were unhappy with the increasing power of the \nplanters and angry at being forced by the planters to give \nthem land on long leases. \nThe indigo peasants also imagined that the British \ngovernment would support them in their struggle  \nagainst the planters. After the Revolt of 1857, the \nBritish government was particularly worried about the \npossibility of another popular rebellion. When the news \nspread of a simmering revolt in the indigo districts, \n A song from an \nindigo-producing \nvillage\nIn the moments of \nstruggle, people often \nsing songs to inspire each \nother and to build a sense \nof collective unity.

The ryots saw the tour as a sign of government \nsympathy for their plight. When in Barasat, the magistrate \nAshley Eden issued a notice stating that ryots would not \nbe compelled to accept indigo contracts, word went around \nthat Queen Victoria had declared that indigo need not be \nsown. Eden was trying to placate the peasants and control \nan explosive situation, but his action was read as support \nfor the rebellion. \nAs the rebellion spread, intellectuals from Calcutta \nrushed to the indigo districts. They wrote of the misery of \nthe ryots, the tyranny of the planters, and the horrors of \nthe indigo system. \nWorried by the rebellion, the government brought in \nthe military to protect the planters from assault, and set \nup the Indigo Commission to enquire into the system of \nindigo production. The Commission held the planters \nguilty, and criticised them for the coercive methods \nthey used with indigo cultivators. It declared that indigo \nproduction was not profitable for ryots.

He \nestablished control over a very large part of the territory \nthat is now known as India. After his death in 1707, \nmany Mughal governors (subadars) and big zamindars \nbegan asserting their authority and establishing regional \nkingdoms. As powerful regional kingdoms emerged in \nvarious parts of India, Delhi could no longer function as \nan effective centre.\nBy the second half of the eighteenth century, \nhowever, a new power was emerging on the political \nhorizon – the British. Did you know that the British \noriginally came as a small trading company and were \nreluctant to acquire territories? How then did they come \nto be masters of a vast empire? In this chapter you will \nsee how this came about.\nFig. 1 – Bahadur Shah Zafar  \nand his sons being arrested by \nCaptain Hodson\nAfter Aurangzeb there was no \npowerful Mughal ruler, but \nMughal emperors continued to \nbe symbolically important. In \nfact, when a massive rebellion \nagainst British rule broke out in \n1857, Bahadur Shah Zafar, the \nMughal emperor at the time, was \nseen as the natural leader. Once \nthe revolt was put down by the \ncompany, Bahadur Shah Zafar \nwas forced to leave the kingdom, \nand his sons were shot in \ncold blood. \nReprint 2024-25\n10\t\nOUR PASTS – III\nEast India Company \nComes East\nIn 1600, the East India \nCompany acquired a charter \nfrom the ruler of England, \nQueen Elizabeth I, granting \nit the sole right to trade with \nthe East. This meant that \nno other trading group in \nEngland could compete with \nthe East India Company. With \nthis charter, the Company \ncould venture across the \noceans, looking for new lands \nfrom which it could buy goods \nat a cheap price, and carry them back to Europe to \nsell at higher prices. The Company did not have to fear \ncompetition from other English trading companies. \nMercantile trading companies in those days made profit \nprimarily by excluding competition, so that they could \nbuy cheap and sell dear.\nThe royal charter, however, could not prevent other \nEuropean powers from entering the Eastern markets. \nBy the time the first English ships sailed down the \nwest coast of Africa, round the Cape of Good Hope, and \ncrossed the Indian Ocean, the Portuguese had already \nestablished their presence in the western coast of India, \nand had their base in Goa. In fact, it was Vasco da \nGama, a Portuguese explorer, who had discovered this \nsea route to India in 1498. By the early seventeenth \ncentury, the Dutch too were exploring the possibilities \nof trade in the Indian Ocean. Soon the French traders \narrived on the scene. \nThe problem was that all the companies were \ninterested in buying the same things. The fine qualities \nof cotton and silk produced in India had a big market \nin Europe. Pepper, cloves, cardamom and cinnamon \ntoo were in great demand. Competition amongst the \nEuropean companies inevitably pushed up the prices \nat which these goods could be purchased, and this \nreduced the profits that could be earned. The only way \nthe trading companies could flourish was by eliminating \nrival competitors. The urge to secure markets, therefore, \nled to fierce battles between the trading companies. \nThrough the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries they \nregularly sank each other’s ships, blockaded routes, \nand prevented rival ships from moving with supplies of\nFig. 2 –  Routes to India in the \neighteenth century\nMercantile – A business \nenterprise that makes \nprofit primarily through \ntrade, buying goods \ncheap and selling them at \nhigher prices\nReprint 2024-25\nFROM TRADE TO TERRITORY         11\ngoods. Trade was carried on with arms and trading posts \nwere protected through fortification. \nThis effort to fortify settlements and carry on profitable \ntrade also led to intense conflict with local rulers. The \ncompany therefore found it difficult to separate trade from \npolitics. Let us see how this happened. \nEast India Company begins trade in Bengal\nThe first English factory was set up on the banks of \nthe river Hugli in 1651. This was the base from which \nthe Company’s traders, known at that time as “factors”, \noperated. The factory had a warehouse where goods for \nexport were stored, and it had offices where Company \nofficials sat. As trade expanded, the Company persuaded \nmerchants and traders to come and settle near the factory. \nBy 1696, it began building a fort around the settlement. \nTwo years later, it bribed Mughal officials into giving the \nCompany zamindari rights over three villages. One of these \nwas Kalikata, which later grew into the city of Calcutta \nor Kolkata as it is known today. It also persuaded the \nMughal emperor Aurangzeb to issue a farman granting \nthe Company the right to trade duty free.\nThe Company tried continuously to press for \nmore concessions and manipulate existing privileges. \nAurangzeb’s farman, for instance, had granted only the \nCompany the right to trade duty free. But officials of  \nthe Company, who were carrying on private trade on \nthe side, were expected to pay duty. This they refused \nto pay, causing an enormous loss of revenue for Bengal. \nHow could the Nawab of Bengal, Murshid Quli Khan, \nnot protest?\nFig. 3 – Local boats bring goods \nfrom ships in Madras, painted by \nWilliam Simpson, 1867\nFarman – A royal edict, \na royal order\nReprint 2024-25\n12\t\nOUR PASTS – III\nHow trade led to battles\nThrough the early eighteenth century, the conflict between \nthe Company and the nawabs of Bengal intensified. \nAfter the death of Aurangzeb, the Bengal nawabs \nasserted their power and autonomy, as other regional \npowers were doing at that time. Murshid Quli Khan \nwas followed by Alivardi Khan and then Sirajuddaulah \nas the Nawab of Bengal. Each one of them was a strong \nruler. They refused to grant the Company concessions, \ndemanded large tributes for the Company’s right to \ntrade, denied it any right to mint coins, and stopped it \nfrom extending its fortifications. Accusing the Company \nof deceit, they claimed that the Company was depriving \nthe Bengal government of huge amounts of revenue and \nundermining the authority of the nawab. It was refusing \nto pay taxes, writing disrespectful letters, and trying to \nhumiliate the nawab and his officials. \nThe Company on its part declared that the unjust \ndemands of the local officials were ruining the trade of \nthe Company, and trade could flourish only if the duties \nwere removed. It was also convinced that to expand trade, \nit had to enlarge its settlements, buy up villages, and \nrebuild its forts.    \nThe conflicts led to confrontations and finally culminated \nin the famous Battle of Plassey.\nThe Battle of Plassey \nWhen Alivardi Khan died in 1756, Sirajuddaulah became \nthe nawab of Bengal. The Company was worried about his \npower and keen on a puppet ruler who would  willingly \ngive trade concessions and other privileges. So it tried, \nthough without success, to help one of Sirajuddaulah’s \nrivals become the nawab. An infuriated Sirajuddaulah \nasked the Company to stop meddling in the political \naffairs of his dominion, stop fortification, and pay the \nrevenues. After negotiations failed, the Nawab marched \nwith 30,000 soldiers to the English factory at Kassimbazar, \ncaptured the Company officials, locked the warehouse, \ndisarmed all Englishmen, and blockaded English ships. \nThen he marched to Calcutta to establish control over the \nCompany’s fort there. \nOn hearing the news of the fall of Calcutta, \nCompany officials in Madras sent forces under the \ncommand of Robert Clive, reinforced by naval fleets. \nProlonged negotiations with the Nawab followed. Finally, \nin 1757, Robert Clive led the Company’s army against \nSirajuddaulah at Plassey. One of the main reasons for \nDid you know?\nDid you know how Plassey \ngot its name? Plassey is an \nanglicised pronunciation  \nof Palashi and the place \nderived its name from the \npalash tree known for its \nbeautiful red flowers that \nyield gulal, the powder \nused in the festival of Holi.\nFig. 4 – Robert Clive \nPuppet – Literally, a toy \nthat you can move with \nstrings. The term is used \ndisapprovingly to refer to \na person who is controlled \nby someone else.\nReprint 2024-25\nFROM TRADE TO TERRITORY         13\nthe defeat of the Nawab was that the forces led by Mir Jafar, one \nof Sirajuddaulah’s commanders, never fought the battle. Clive had \nmanaged to secure his support by promising to make him nawab after \ncrushing Sirajuddaulah. \nThe Battle of Plassey became famous because it was the first major \nvictory the Company won in India. \nFig. 5 – The General \nCourt Room, East \nIndia House, \nLeadenhall Street\nThe Court of \nProprietors of the \nEast India Company \nhad their meetings \nin the East India \nHouse on Leadenhall \nStreet in London. \nThis is a picture of \none of their meetings \nin progress.\nThe promise of riches\nThe territorial ambitions of the mercantile East India \nCompany were viewed with distrust and doubt in England. \nAfter the Battle of Plassey, Robert Clive wrote to William \nPitt, one of the Principal Secretaries of State to the English \nmonarch, on 7 January 1759 from Calcutta: \nBut so large a sovereignty may possibly be an object too \nextensive for a mercantile Company … I flatter myself \n… that there will be little or no difficulty in obtaining \nthe absolute possession of these rich kingdoms: ... Now \nI leave you to judge, whether an income yearly of two \nmillion sterling with the possession of three provinces \n… be an object deserving the public attention ...\nSource 1\nFig. 6 –  Sirajuddaulah\nReprint 2024-25\n14\t\nOUR PASTS – III\nAfter the defeat at Plassey, Sirajuddaulah was \nassassinated and Mir Jafar made the nawab. The Company \nwas still unwilling to take over the responsibility of \nadministration. Its prime objective was the expansion of \ntrade. If this could be done without conquest, through the \nhelp of local rulers who were willing to grant privileges, \nthen territories need not be taken over directly. \nSoon the Company discovered that this was rather \ndifficult. For even the puppet nawabs were not always \nas helpful as the Company wanted them to be. After all, \nthey had to maintain a basic appearance of dignity and \nsovereignty if they wanted respect from their subjects. \nWhat could the Company do? When Mir Jafar \nprotested, the Company deposed him and installed Mir \nQasim in his place. When Mir Qasim complained, he in \nturn was defeated in a battle fought at Buxar (1764), \ndriven out of Bengal, and Mir Jafar was reinstalled. \nThe Nawab had to pay Rs. 500,000 every month but \nthe Company wanted more money to finance its wars, \nand meet the demands of trade and its other expenses. \nIt wanted more territories and more revenue. By the \ntime Mir Jafar died in 1765, the mood of the Company \nhad changed. Having failed to work with puppet \nnawabs, Clive declared: “We must indeed become  \nnawabs ourselves”.\nFinally, in 1765 the Mughal emperor appointed the \nCompany as the Diwan of the provinces of Bengal. The \nDiwani allowed the Company to use the vast revenue \nresources of Bengal. This solved a major problem that \nthe Company had earlier faced. From the early eighteenth \ncentury, its trade with India had expanded. But it had \nto buy most of the goods in India with gold and silver \nimported from Britain. This was because at this time \nBritain had no goods to sell in India. The outflow of \ngold from Britain slowed after the Battle of Plassey, and \nentirely stopped after the assumption of Diwani. Now \nrevenues from India could finance Company expenses. \nThese revenues could be used to purchase cotton and \nsilk textiles in India, maintain Company troops, and \nmeet the cost of building the Company fort and offices \nat Calcutta.  \nCompany officials become “nabobs” (nawabs)\nWhat did it mean to be nawabs? It meant of course that \nthe Company acquired more power and authority. But it \nalso meant something else. Each company servant began \nto have visions of living like nawabs.\nSource 2\nThe Nawab \ncomplains\nIn 1733 the Nawab of \nBengal said this about \nthe English traders:\nWhen they first came \ninto the country they \npetitioned the then \ngovernment \nin \na \nhumble manner for \nliberty to purchase \na spot of ground to \nbuild a factory house \nupon, which was no \nsooner granted but \nthey built a strong \nfort, surrounded it \nwith a ditch which \nhas communication \nwith the river and \nmounted \na \ngreat \nnumber \nof \nguns \nupon \nthe \nwalls. \nThey have enticed \nseveral \nmerchants \nand others to go \nand take protection \nunder them and they \ncollect \na \nrevenue \nwhich amounts to \nRs. 100,000… they \nrob and plunder and \ncarry great number \nof the king’s subjects \nof both sexes into \nslavery \ninto \ntheir \nown country … \nReprint 2024-25\nFROM TRADE TO TERRITORY         15\nAfter the Battle of Plassey, the actual nawabs of \nBengal were forced to give land and vast sums of \nmoney as personal gifts to Company officials. Robert \nClive himself amassed a fortune in India. He had come \nto Madras (now Chennai) from England in 1743 at \nthe age of 18. When in 1767 he left India, his Indian \nfortune was worth £401,102. Interestingly, when he was \nappointed Governor of Bengal in 1764, he was asked \nto remove corruption in Company administration but \nhe was himself cross-examined in 1772 by the British \nParliament which was suspicious of his vast wealth. \nAlthough he was acquitted, he committed suicide \nin 1774. \nHowever, not all Company officials succeeded in \nmaking money like Clive. Many died an early death \nin India due to disease and war, and it would not be \nright to regard all of them as corrupt and dishonest. \nMany of them came from humble backgrounds \nand their uppermost desire was to earn enough in \nIndia, return to Britain and lead a comfortable life. \nThose who managed to return with wealth led flashy \nlives and flaunted their riches. They were called \n“nabobs” – an anglicised version of the Indian word \nnawab. They were often seen as upstarts and social \nclimbers in British society and were ridiculed or made \nfun of in plays and cartoons. \nCompany Rule Expands\nIf we analyse the process of annexation of Indian states \nby the East India Company from 1757 to 1857, certain \nkey aspects emerge. The Company rarely launched a \ndirect military attack on an unknown territory. Instead \nit used a variety of political, economic and diplomatic \nmethods to extend its influence before annexing an \nIndian kingdom. \nAfter the Battle of Buxar (1764), the Company \nappointed Residents in Indian states. They were \npolitical or commercial agents and their job was to serve \nand further the interests of the Company. Through the \nResidents, the Company officials began interfering in \nthe internal affairs of Indian states. They tried to decide \nwho was to be the successor to the throne, and who was \nto be appointed in administrative posts. Sometimes, the \nCompany forced the states into a “subsidiary alliance”. \nAccording to the terms of this alliance, Indian rulers \nwere not allowed to have their independent armed \nforces. They were to be protected by the Company, but \nHow did Clive\nsee himself?\nAt his hearing in front  of \na Committee in Parliament, \nClive declared that he had \nshown admirable restraint \nafter the Battle of Plassey. \nThis is what he said:\nConsider the situation \nin which the victory \nat Plassey had placed \nme! A great prince \nwas dependent on my \npleasure; an opulent \ncity lay at my mercy; \nits richest bankers bid \nagainst each other for \nmy smiles; I walked \nthrough vaults which \nwere thrown open to me \nalone, piled on either \nhand with gold and \njewels!

If the Indian rulers failed to make the payment, \nthen part of their territory was taken away as penalty. \nFor example, when Richard Wellesley was Governor-\nGeneral (1798–1805), the Nawab of Awadh was forced \nto give over half of his territory to the Company in 1801, \nas he failed to pay for the “subsidiary forces”. Hyderabad \nwas also forced to cede territories on similar grounds.\nWhat power did the Resident have?\nThis is what James Mill, the famous economist and \npolitical philosopher from Scotland, wrote about the \nresidents appointed by the Company. \nWe place a resident, who really is king of the \ncountry, whatever injunctions of non-interference \nhe may act under. As long as the prince acts in \nperfect subservience, and does what is agreeable \nto the residents, that is, to the British Government, \nthings go on quietly; they are managed without the \nresident appearing much in the administration of \naffairs … but when anything of a different nature \nhappens, the moment the prince takes a course \nwhich the British Government think wrong, then \ncomes clashing and disturbance.\nJames Mill (1832)\nTipu Sultan – The “Tiger of Mysore”\nThe Company resorted to direct military confrontation when \nit saw a threat to its political or economic interests. This \ncan be illustrated with the case of the southern Indian state \nof Mysore.\nMysore had grown in strength under the leadership \nof powerful rulers like Haidar Ali (ruled from 1761 to \n1782) and his famous son Tipu Sultan (ruled from 1782 \nto 1799). Mysore controlled the profitable trade of the \nMalabar coast where the Company purchased pepper \nand cardamom. In 1785, Tipu Sultan stopped the export \nof sandalwood, pepper and cardamom through the ports \nof his kingdom, and disallowed local merchants from \ntrading with the Company. He also established a close \nFig. 8  – Tipu Sultan\nReprint 2024-25\nfrom trade to territory         17\nrelationship with the French in India, and modernised \nhis army with their help. \nThe British were furious. They saw Haidar and Tipu \nas ambitious, arrogant and dangerous – rulers who had \nto be controlled and crushed. Four wars were fought with \nMysore (1767–69, 1780–84, 1790–92 and 1799). Only in \nthe last – the Battle of Shrirangapatnam – did the Company \nultimately win a victory. Tipu Sultan was killed defending \nhis capital Shrirangapatnam, Mysore was placed under the \nformer ruling dynasty of the Wodeyars and a subsidiary \nalliance was imposed on the state. \nFig. 10 – Tipu’s toy tiger \nThis is the picture of a big mechanical toy that Tipu possessed.  \nYou can see a tiger mauling a European soldier. When its handle \nwas turned, the toy tiger roared and the soldier shrieked. This  \ntoy-tiger is now kept in the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. \nThe British took it away when Tipu Sultan died defending his \ncapital Shrirangapatnam on 4 May 1799.\nFig. 9 – Cornwallis receiving the \nsons of Tipu Sultan as hostages, \npainted by Daniel Orme, 1793\nThe Company forces were \ndefeated by Haidar Ali and Tipu \nSultan in several battles. But in \n1792, attacked by the combined \nforces of the Marathas, the Nizam \nof Hyderabad and the Company, \nTipu was forced to sign a treaty \nwith the British by which two \nof his sons were  taken away \nas hostages. British painters \nalways liked painting scenes that \nshowed the triumph of  \nBritish power.\nThe legend of Tipu\nKings are often surrounded \nby legend and their powers \nglorified through folklore. \nHere is a legend about Tipu \nSultan who became the \nruler of Mysore in 1782. It \nis said that once he went \nhunting in the forest with \na French friend. There he \ncame face to face with a \ntiger. His gun did not work \nand his dagger fell to the \nground. He battled with \nthe tiger unarmed until he  \nmanaged to reach down \nand pick up the dagger. \nFinally, he was able to kill \nthe tiger in the battle. After \nthis, he came to be known \nas the “Tiger of Mysore”. He \nhad the image of the tiger \non his flag. \nReprint 2024-25\n18\t\nOUR PASTS – III\nWar with the Marathas \nFrom the late eighteenth century, the Company also \nsought to curb and eventually destroy Maratha power. \nWith their defeat in the Third Battle of Panipat in 1761, \nthe Marathas’ dream of ruling from Delhi was shattered. \nThey were divided into many states under different chiefs \n(sardars) belonging to dynasties such as Sindhia, Holkar, \nGaikwad and Bhonsle. These chiefs were held together \nin a confederacy under a Peshwa (Principal Minister) \nwho became its effective military and administrative head \nbased in Pune. Mahadji Sindhia and Nana Phadnis were \ntwo famous Maratha soldiers and statesmen of the late \neighteenth century. \nThe Marathas were subdued in a series of wars. \nIn the first war that ended in 1782 with the Treaty of \nSalbai, there was no clear victor. The Second Anglo-\nMaratha War (1803–05) was fought on different fronts, \nresulting in the British gaining Orissa and the territories \nnorth of the Yamuna river including Agra and Delhi. \nFinally, the Maratha power came to end with the Third  \nAnglo-Maratha War of 1817–19. The Peshwa was \nremoved and sent away to Bithur near Kanpur with a \npension. The Company now had complete control over \nthe territories south of the Vindhyas. \nThe claim to paramountcy\nIt is clear from the above that from the early \nnineteenth century, the Company pursued an aggressive \npolicy of territorial expansion. Under Lord Hastings \n(Governor-General from 1813 to 1823), a new policy of \n“paramountcy” was initiated. Now the Company claimed \nthat its authority was paramount or supreme, hence its \npower was greater than that of Indian states. In order \nto protect its interests, it was justified in annexing or \nthreatening to annex any Indian kingdom. This view \ncontinued to guide later British policies as well. \nThis process, however, did not go unchallenged. For \nexample, when the British tried to annex the small state \nof Kitoor (in Karnataka today), Rani Channamma took \nto arms and led an anti-British resistance movement. \nShe was arrested in 1824 and died in prison in 1829. \nBut Rayanna, a poor chowkidar of Sangoli in Kitoor, \ncarried on the resistance. With popular support, he \ndestroyed many British camps and records. He was \ncaught and hanged by the British in 1830. You will \nread more about several cases of resistance later in  \nthe book.\nFig. 11 – Lord Hastings\n. \n \nConfederacy – Alliance\nActivity\nImagine that you \nhave come across \ntwo old newspapers \nreporting on the Battle \nof Shrirangapatnam \nand the death of Tipu \nSultan.

Driven by this fear, the British \nnow wanted to secure their control over \nthe north-west. They fought a prolonged \nwar with Afghanistan between 1838 and \n1842, and established indirect Company \nrule there. Sind was taken over in 1843. \nNext in line was Punjab. But the presence \nof Maharaja Ranjit Singh held back the \nCompany. After his death in 1839, two \nprolonged wars were fought with the Sikh \nkingdom. Ultimately, in 1849, Punjab \nwas annexed.\nThe Doctrine of Lapse\nThe final wave of annexations occurred \nunder Lord Dalhousie who was the \nGovernor-General from 1848 to 1856. \nHe devised a policy that came to be \nknown as the Doctrine of Lapse. The \ndoctrine declared that if an Indian ruler \ndied without a male heir his kingdom \nwould “lapse”, that is, become a part \nof Company territory. One kingdom \nafter another was annexed simply by \napplying this doctrine: Satara (1848), \nSambalpur (1850), Udaipur (1852), Nagpur (1853) and \nJhansi (1854). \nFinally, in 1856, the Company also took over Awadh. \nThis time the British had an added argument – they said \nthey were “obliged by duty” to take over Awadh in order to \nfree the people from the “misgovernment” of the Nawab! \nEnraged by the humiliating way in which  the Nawab was \ndeposed, the people of Awadh joined the great revolt that \nbroke out in 1857.\nFig. 13  – Maharaja Ranjit Singh \nholding court  \nFig. 14  – A portrait of  Veer \nSurendra Sai \nActivity\nImagine that you are a nawab’s nephew and have been \nbrought up thinking that you will one day be king.

British \nterritories were broadly divided into administrative units \ncalled Presidencies. There were three Presidencies:  Bengal, \nMadras and Bombay. Each was ruled by a Governor. The \nsupreme head of the administration was the Governor-\nGeneral. Warren Hastings, the first Governor-General, \nintroduced several administrative reforms, notably in the \nsphere of justice. \nFrom 1772 a new system of justice was established. \nEach district was to have two courts – a criminal court \n(faujdari adalat) and a civil court (diwani adalat). Maulvis \nand Hindu pandits interpreted Indian laws for the \nEuropean district collectors who presided over civil courts. \nThe criminal courts were still under a qazi and a mufti \nbut under the supervision of the collectors. \nQazi – A judge\nMufti – A jurist of the \nMuslim community \nresponsible for \nexpounding the law           \nthat the qazi would \nadminister\nImpeachment – A trial \nby the House of Lords           \nin England for charges \nof misconduct brought \nagainst a person in the \nHouse of Commons\nFig. 15 – The trial of Warren Hastings, painted by R.G.

To bring about uniformity, \nin 1775 eleven pandits were asked to compile a digest \nof Hindu laws. N.B. Halhed translated this digest into \nEnglish. By 1778, a code of Muslim laws was also compiled \nfor the benefit of European judges. Under the Regulating \nAct of 1773, a new Supreme Court was established, while \na court of appeal – the Sadar Nizamat Adalat – was also \nset up at Calcutta.\nThe principal figure in an Indian district was the \nCollector. As the title suggests, his main job was to collect \nrevenue and taxes and maintain law and order in his \ndistrict with the help of judges, police officers and darogas. \nHis office – the Collectorate – became the new centre of \npower and patronage that steadily replaced previous \nholders of authority.\nThe Company army\nColonial rule in India brought in some new ideas of \nadministration and reform but its power rested on its \nmilitary strength. The Mughal army was mainly composed \nof cavalry (sawars: trained soldiers on horseback) and \ninfantry, that is, paidal (foot) soldiers. They were given \ntraining in archery (teer-andazi) and the use of the sword. \nThe cavalry dominated the army and the Mughal state \ndid not feel the need to have a large professionally trained \ninfantry. The rural areas had a large number of armed \npeasants and the local zamindars often supplied the \nMughals with paidal soldiers.\nA change occurred in the eighteenth century when \nMughal successor states like Awadh and Banaras started \nrecruiting peasants into their armies and training them \nas professional soldiers. The East India Company adopted \nthe same method when it began recruitment for its own \narmy, which came to be known as the sepoy army (from \nthe Indian word sipahi, meaning soldier). \nAs warfare technology changed from the 1820s, the \ncavalry requirements of the Company’s army declined. \nThis is because the British empire was fighting in \nBurma, Afghanistan and Egypt where soldiers were \narmed with muskets and matchlocks. The soldiers of \nthe Company’s army had to keep pace with changing \nmilitary requirements and its infantry regiments now \nbecame more important. \nIn the early nineteenth century, the British began \nto develop a uniform military culture. Soldiers were \nHere is a passage from \nEdmund Burke’s eloquent \nopening speech during \nthe impeachment of \nWarren Hastings:\nI impeach him in the \nname of the people \nof India, whose rights \nhe has trodden under \nhis foot and whose \ncountry he has turned \ninto a desert.

Often this created problems since caste and \ncommunity feelings were ignored in building a force \nof professional soldiers. Could individuals so easily \ngive up their caste and religious feelings? Could they \nsee themselves only as soldiers and not as members \nof communities? \nWhat did the sepoys feel? How did they react to the \nchanges in their lives and their identity – that is, their \nsense of who they were? The Revolt of 1857 gives us a \nglimpse into the world of the sepoys. You will read about \nthis revolt in Chapter 5.\nConclusion\nThus the East India Company was transformed from a \ntrading company to a territorial colonial power. The arrival \nof new steam technology in the early nineteenth century \nalso aided this process.

    "text": "Introduction: \nHow, When and Where\n1\nHow Important are Dates?\nThere was a time when historians were \nfascinated with dates. There were heated \ndebates about the dates on which rulers \nwere crowned or battles were fought. In \nthe common-sense notion, history was \nsynonymous with dates. You may have \nheard people say, “I find history boring \nbecause it is all about memorising \ndates.” Is such a conception true?\nHistory is certainly about changes \nthat occur over time. It is about \nfinding out how things were in the \npast and how things have changed. \nAs soon as we compare the past with \nthe present, we refer to time, we talk of \n“before” and “after”. \nLiving in the world we do not always \nask historical questions about what \nwe see around us. We take things for \ngranted, as if what we see has always \nbeen in the world we inhabit. But most of \nus have our moments of wonder, when we are \ncurious, and we ask questions that actually are historical. \nWatching someone sip a cup of tea at a roadside tea stall, \nyou may wonder – when did people begin to drink tea or \ncoffee? Looking out of the window of a train you may ask \nyourself – when were railways built and how did people \ntravel long distances before the age of railways? Reading \nthe newspaper in the morning you may be curious to know \nhow people got to hear about things before newspapers \nbegan to be printed.  \nFig. 1 – Brahmans offering the \nShastras to Britannia, frontispiece \nto the first map produced by \nJames Rennel, 1782\nRennel was asked by Robert Clive \nto produce maps of Hindustan. \nAn enthusiastic supporter \nof British conquest of India, \nRennel saw preparation of maps \nas essential to the process of \ndomination. The picture here \ntries to suggest that Indians \nwillingly gave over their ancient \ntexts to Britannia – the symbol of \nBritish power – as if asking her \nto become the protector of Indian \nculture.\nActivity\nLook carefully at Fig.1 and write a paragraph explaining \nhow this image projects an imperial perception.\n\nReprint 2024-25\n2\t\nOUR PASTS – III\nAll such historical questions refer us back to \nnotions of time. But time does not have to be always \nprecisely dated in terms of a particular year or a month. \nSometimes it is actually incorrect to fix precise dates \nto processes that happen over a period of time. People \nin India did not begin drinking tea one fine day; they \ndeveloped a taste for it over time. There can be no \none clear date for a process such as this. Similarly, \nwe cannot fix one single date on which British rule \nwas established, or the national movement started, or \nchanges took place within the economy and society. All \nthese things happened over a stretch of time. We can \nonly refer to a span of time, an approximate period over \nwhich particular changes became visible.\nWhy, then, do we continue to associate history with \na string of dates? This association has a reason. There \nwas a time when history was an account of battles and big \nevents. It was about rulers and their policies. Historians \nwrote about the year a king was crowned, the year he \nmarried, the year he had a child, the year he fought a \nparticular war, the year he died, and the year the next \nruler succeeded to the throne. For events such as these, \nspecific dates can be determined, and in histories such \nas these, debates about dates continue to be important. \nAs you have seen in the history textbooks of the past \ntwo years, historians now write about a host of other \nissues, and other questions. They look at how people \nearned their livelihood, what they produced and ate, how \ncities developed and markets came up, how kingdoms \nwere formed and new ideas spread, and how cultures \nand society changed.\nWhich dates?\nBy what criteria do we choose a set of dates as \nimportant? The dates we select, the dates around which \nwe compose our story of the past, are not important \non their own. They become vital because we focus on \na particular set of events as important. If our focus of \nstudy changes, if we begin to look at new issues, a new \nset of dates will appear significant. \nConsider an example. In the histories written by \nBritish historians in India, the rule of each Governor-\nGeneral was important. These histories began with the \nrule of the first Governor-General, Warren Hastings, \nand ended with the last Viceroy, Lord Mountbatten. In \nseparate chapters, we read about the deeds of others —\nHastings, Wellesley, Bentinck, Dalhousie, Canning, \nFig. 2 – Advertisements help \ncreate taste\nOld advertisements help us \nunderstand how markets for new \nproducts were created and new \ntastes were popularised. This \n1922 advertisement for Lipton tea \nsuggests that royalty all over the \nworld is associated with this tea. \nIn the background you see the \nouter wall of an Indian palace, \nwhile in the foreground, seated \non horseback is the third son of \nQueen Victoria of Britain, Prince \nArthur, who was given the title \nDuke of Connaught.\nReprint 2024-25\nINTRODUCTION: HOW, WHEN AND WHERE         3\nLawrence, Lytton, Ripon, Curzon, Harding, Irwin. It \nwas a seemingly never-ending succession of Governor- \nGenerals and Viceroys. All the dates in these history books \nwere linked to these personalities – to their activities, \npolicies and achievements. It was as if there was nothing \noutside their lives that was important for us to know. The \nchronology of their lives marked the different chapters of \nthe history of British India. \nCan we not write about the history of this period in a \ndifferent way? How do we focus on the activities of different \ngroups and classes in Indian society within the format of \nthis history of Governor-Generals? \nWhen we write history, or a story, we divide it into \nchapters. Why do we do this? It is to give each chapter \nsome coherence. It is to tell a story in a way that makes \nsome sense and can be followed. In the process we focus \nonly on those events that help us to give shape to the story \nwe are telling. In the histories that revolve around the life \nof British Governor-Generals, the activities of Indians \nsimply do not fit, they have no space. What, then, do we \ndo? Clearly, we need another format for our history. This \nwould mean that the old dates will no longer have the \nsignificance they earlier had. A new set of dates will become \nmore important for us to know.  \nHow do we periodise? \nIn 1817, James Mill, a Scottish economist and political \nphilosopher, published a massive three-volume work, \nA History of British India. In this, he divided Indian \nhistory into three periods – Hindu, Muslim and British. \nThis periodisation came to be widely accepted. Can \nyou think of any problem with this way of looking at \nIndian history?\nWhy do we try and divide history into different periods? \nWe do so in an attempt to capture the characteristics of \na time, its central features as they appear to us. So the \nterms through which we periodise – that is, demarcate \nthe difference between periods – become important. They \nreflect our ideas about the past. They show how we see \nthe significance of the change from one period to the next. \nMill thought that all Asian societies were at a lower \nlevel of civilisation than Europe. According to  his telling \nof history, before the British came to India, Hindu and \nMuslim despots ruled the country. Religious intolerance, \ncaste taboos and superstitious practices dominated  \nsocial life. British rule, Mill felt, could civilise India. To do \nFig. 3 – Warren Hastings became \nthe first Governor-General in 1773\nWhile history books narrated \nthe deeds of Governor-Generals, \nbiographies glorified them as \npersons, and paintings projected \nthem as powerful figures. \nInterview your mother \nor another member of \nyour family to find out \nabout their life. Now \ndivide their life into \ndifferent periods and \nlist out the significant \nevents in each period.  \nExplain the basis of your \nperiodisation.\nActivity\n\nReprint 2024-25\n4\t\nOUR PASTS – III\nthis, it was necessary to introduce European manners, arts, \ninstitutions and laws in India. Mill, in fact, suggested that the \nBritish should conquer all the territories in India to ensure \nthe enlightenment and happiness of the Indian people. For \nIndia was not capable of progress without British help.\nIn this idea of history, British rule represented all the forces \nof progress and civilisation. The period before British rule was \none of darkness. Can such a conception be accepted today?\nIn any case, can we refer to any period of history as “Hindu” \nor “Muslim”? Did not a variety of faiths exist simultaneously \nin these periods? Why should we characterise an age only \nthrough the religion of the rulers of the time? To do so is to \nsuggest that the lives and practices of the others do not really \nmatter. We should also remember that even rulers in ancient \nIndia did not all share the same faith.\nMoving away from British classification, historians \nhave usually divided Indian history into ‘ancient’, ‘medieval’ \nand ‘modern’. This division too has its problems. It is a \nperiodisation that is borrowed from the West where the \nmodern period was associated with the growth of all the \nforces of modernity – science, reason, democracy, liberty \nand equality. Medieval was a term used to describe a society \nwhere these features of modern society did not exist. Can \nwe uncritically accept this characterisation of the modern \nperiod to describe the period of our study? As you will see in \nthis book, under British rule people did not have equality, \nfreedom or liberty. Nor was the period one of economic \ngrowth and progress.\nMany historians therefore refer to this period as ‘colonial’. \nWhat is colonial? \nIn this book, you will read about the way the British came \nto conquer the country and establish their rule, subjugating \nlocal nawabs and rajas. You will see how they established \ncontrol over the economy and society, collected revenue to \nmeet all their expenses, bought the goods they wanted at low \nprices, produced crops they needed for export, and you will \nunderstand the changes that came about as a consequence. \nYou will also come to know about the changes British rule \nbrought about in values and tastes, customs and practices. \nWhen the subjugation of one country by another leads to these \nkinds of political, economic, social and cultural changes, we \nrefer to the process as colonisation. \nYou will, however, find that all classes and groups did not \nexperience these changes in the same way. That is why, the \nbook is called Our Pasts in the plural.\nReprint 2024-25\nINTRODUCTION: HOW, WHEN AND WHERE         5\nHow do We Know?\nWhat sources do historians use in writing about the last \n250 years of Indian history? \nAdministration produces records\nOne important source is the official records of the British \nadministration. The British believed that the act of writing \nwas important. Every instruction, plan, policy decision, \nagreement, investigation had to be clearly written up. Once \nthis was done, things could be properly studied and debated. \nThis conviction produced an administrative culture of \nmemos, notings and reports. \nThe British also felt that all important documents \nand letters needed to be carefully preserved. So they \nset up record rooms attached to all administrative \ninstitutions. The village tahsildar’s office, the collectorate, \nthe commissioner’s office, the provincial secretariats, \nthe lawcourts – all had their record rooms. Specialised \ninstitutions like archives and museums were also \nestablished to preserve important records.\nLetters and memos that moved from one branch \nof the administration to another in the early years \nof the nineteenth century can still be read in the \narchives. You can also study the notes and reports \nthat district officials prepared, or the instructions \nand directives that were sent by officials at the top to \nprovincial administrators. \nIn the early years of the nineteenth century, these \ndocuments were carefully copied out and beautifully \nwritten by calligraphists – that is, by those who specialised \nin the art of beautiful writing. By the middle of the \nnineteenth century, with the spread of printing, multiple \ncopies of these records were printed as proceedings of each \ngovernment department. \nSource 1\nReports to the  \nHome Department\nIn 1946 the colonial \ngovernment in India was \ntrying to put down a mutiny \nthat broke out on the ships \nof the Royal Indian Navy. \nHere is a sample of the \nkind of reports the Home \nDepartment got from the \ndifferent dockyards:\nBombay: Arrangements \nhave been made for the \nArmy to take over ships \nand establishment. Royal \nNavy ships are remaining \noutside the harbour.\nKarachi: 301 mutineers \nare under arrest and a few \nmore strongly suspected \nare to be arrested … All \nestablishments … are \nunder military guard.\nVizagapatnam: \nThe \npositionis \ncompletely \nunder control and no \nviolence has occurred. \nMilitary guards have \nbeen placed on ships \nand \nestablishments.\nNo further trouble is \nexpected except that \na few men may refuse  \nto work.\nDirector of Intelligence, HQ.

This location \nreflects the importance these institutions had in British imagination.\nReprint 2024-25\n6\t\nOUR PASTS – III\nSurveys become important\nThe practice of surveying also became common under \nthe colonial administration. The British believed that \na country had to be properly known before it could be \neffectively administered. \nBy the early nineteenth century, detailed surveys \nwere being carried out to map the entire country.  In \nthe villages, revenue surveys were conducted. The \neffort was to know the topography, the soil quality, \nthe flora, the fauna, the local histories, and the \ncropping pattern – all the facts seen as necessary \nto know about to administer the region. From the \nend of the nineteenth century, Census operations \nwere held every ten years. These prepared detailed \nrecords of the number of people in all the provinces \nof India, noting information on castes, religions and \noccupation. There were many other surveys – botanical \nsurveys, zoological surveys, archaeological surveys, \nanthropological surveys, forest surveys. \nWhat official records do not tell\nFrom this vast corpus of records we can get to know \na lot, but we must remember that these are official \nrecords. They tell us what the officials thought, what \nFig. 6 – Mapping and survey operations in progress in Bengal, a drawing by James Prinsep, 1832\nNote how all the instruments that were used in surveys are placed in the foreground to \nemphasise the scientific nature of the project.\nFig. 5 – A \ncustard-apple \nplant, 1770s\nBotanical gardens \nand natural history \nmuseums established by the \nBritish collected plant specimens \nand information about their \nuses. Local artists were asked to \ndraw pictures of these specimens. \nHistorians are now looking \nat the way such information \nwas gathered and what this \ninformation reveals about the \nnature of colonialism.\nReprint 2024-25\nINTRODUCTION: HOW, WHEN AND WHERE         7\nthey were interested in, and what they wished to preserve \nfor posterity. These records do not always help us \nunderstand what other people in the country felt, and what \nlay behind their actions. \nFor that we need to look elsewhere. When we begin to \nsearch for these other sources, we find them in plenty, \nthough they are more difficult to get than official records. \nWe have diaries of people, accounts of pilgrims and \ntravellers, autobiographies of important personalities, and \npopular booklets that were sold in the local bazaars. As \nprinting spread, newspapers were published and issues \nwere debated in public. Leaders and reformers wrote to \nspread their ideas, poets and novelists wrote to express \ntheir feelings. \nAll these sources, however, were produced by those who \nwere literate. From these, we will not be able to understand \nhow history was experienced and lived by the tribals and \nthe peasants, the workers in the mines or the poor on the \nstreets. Getting to know their lives is a more difficult task. \nYet this can be done, if we make a little bit of effort. \nWhen you read this book, you will see how this can \nbe done. \nFig. 7 – The rebels of 1857\nImages need to be carefully studied for they project the viewpoint \nof those who create them. This image can be found in several \nillustrated books produced by the British after the 1857 rebellion. \nThe caption at the bottom says: “Mutinous sepoys share the loot”. \nIn British representations, the rebels appear as greedy, vicious and \nbrutal. You will read about the rebellion in Chapter 5. \n“Not fit for human \nconsumption”\nNewspapers provide \naccounts of the movements \nin different parts of the \ncountry. Here is a report \nof  a  police strike in 1946.\nMore \nthan \n2000 \npolicemen in Delhi \nrefused to take their \nfood on Thursday \nmorning as a protest \nagainst \ntheir \nlow \nsalaries \nand \nthe \nbad quality of food \nsupplied \nto \nthem \nfrom the Police Lines \nkitchen.\nAs the news spread \nto the other police \nstations, \nthe \nmen \nthere also refused to \ntake food … One of \nthe strikers said: “The \nfood supplied to us \nfrom the Police Lines \nkitchen is not fit for \nhuman consumption. \nEven \ncattle \nwould \nnot eat the chappattis \nand dal which we \nhave to eat.”\nHindustan Times,                                  \n22 March, 1946\nSource 2\nLook at Sources 1 and 2. \nDo you find any \ndifferences in the nature \nof reporting?

Kings, queens, peasants, landlords, tribals, soldiers \nwere all affected in different ways. You have also seen how \npeople resist policies and actions that harm their interests \nor go against their sentiments. \nNawabs lose their power\nSince the mid-eighteenth century, nawabs and rajas had \nseen their power erode. They had gradually lost their \nauthority and honour. Residents had been stationed in \nmany courts, the freedom of the rulers reduced, their \narmed forces disbanded, and their revenues and territories \ntaken away by stages. \nMany ruling families tried to negotiate with the \nCompany to protect their interests. For example, Rani \nLakshmibai of Jhansi wanted the Company to recognise \nher adopted son as the heir to the kingdom after the \ndeath of her husband. Nana Saheb, the adopted son of \nFig. 1 – Sepoys and peasants \ngather forces for the revolt that \nspread across the plains of north \nIndia in 1857\nReprint 2024-25\n52\t\nOUR PASTS – III\nPeshwa Baji Rao II, pleaded that he be given his father’s \npension when the latter died. However, the Company, \nconfident of its superiority and military powers, turned \ndown these pleas. \nAwadh was one of the last territories to be annexed. \nIn 1801, a subsidiary alliance was imposed on Awadh, \nand in 1856 it was taken over. Governor-General \nDalhousie declared that the territory was being \nmisgoverned and British rule was needed to ensure \nproper administration. \nThe Company even began to plan how to bring the \nMughal dynasty to an end. The name of the Mughal king \nwas removed from the coins minted by the Company. In \n1849, Governor-General Dalhousie announced that after \nthe death of Bahadur Shah Zafar, the family of the king \nwould be shifted out of the Red Fort and given another \nplace in Delhi to reside in. In 1856, Governor-General \nCanning decided that Bahadur Shah Zafar would be \nthe last Mughal king and after his death none of his \ndescendants would be recognised as kings – they would \njust be called princes.\nThe peasants and the sepoys\nIn the countryside, peasants and zamindars resented \nthe high taxes and the rigid methods of revenue \ncollection. Many failed to pay back their loans to the \nmoneylenders and gradually lost the lands they had \ntilled for generations. \nThe Indian sepoys in the employ of the Company \nalso had reasons for discontent. They were unhappy \nabout their pay, allowances and conditions of service. \nSome of the new rules, moreover, violated their religious \nsensibilities and beliefs. Did you know that in those \ndays many people in the country believed that if they \ncrossed the sea they would lose their religion and caste? \nSo when in 1824, the sepoys were told to go to Burma \nby the sea route to fight for the Company, they refused \nto follow the order, though they agreed to go by the \nland route. They were severely punished, and since the \nissue did not die down, in 1856 the Company passed a \nnew law which stated that every new person who took \nup employment in the Company’s army had to agree to \nserve overseas if required.  \nSepoys also reacted to what was happening in the \ncountryside. Many of them were peasants and had families \nliving in the villages. So the anger of the peasants quickly \nspread among the sepoys.\nActivity\nImagine you are a sepoy \nin the Company army, \nadvising your nephew \nnot to take employment \nin the army. What reasons \nwould you give? \n\nReprint 2024-25\nwhen people revolt         53\nSource 1\nResponses to reforms \nThe British believed that Indian society had \nto be reformed. Laws were passed to stop the \npractice of sati and to encourage the remarriage \nof widows. English-language education was \nactively promoted. After 1830, the Company \nallowed Christian missionaries to function freely \nin its domain and even own land and property. In \n1850, a new law was passed to  make conversion \nto Christianity easier. This  law allowed an Indian \nwho had converted to Christianity to inherit the \nproperty of his ancestors. Many Indians began to \nfeel that the British were destroying their religion, \ntheir social customs and their traditional way  \nof life. \nThere were of course other Indians who wanted \nto change existing social practices. You will read \nabout these reformers and reform movements in \nChapter 6.\nThrough the Eyes of the People\nTo get a glimpse of what people were thinking those days \nabout British rule, study Sources 1 and 2. \nThe list of eighty-four rules\nGiven here are excerpts from the book Majha Pravaas, written by Vishnubhatt \nGodse, a Brahman from a village in Maharashtra. He and his uncle had set out to \nattend a yajna being organised in Mathura. Vishnubhatt writes that they met some \nsepoys on the way who told them that they should not proceed on the journey \nbecause a massive upheaval was going to break out in three days. The sepoys said:\nthe English were determined to wipe out the religions of the Hindus and the \nMuslims … they had made a list of eighty-four rules and announced these  in \na gathering of all big kings and princes in Calcutta. They said that the kings \nrefused to accept these rules and warned the English of dire consequences \nand massive upheaval if these are implemented … that the kings all returned \nto their capitals in great anger … all the big people began making plans. A \ndate was fixed for the war of religion and the secret plan had been circulated \nfrom the cantonment in Meerut by letters sent to different cantonments.\nVishnubhatt Godse,  Majha Pravaas, pp. 23-24.\nFig. 2 – Sepoys exchange news \nand rumours in the bazaars of \nnorth India\nReprint 2024-25\n54\t\nOUR PASTS – III\n“There was soon excitement in every regiment”\nAnother account we have from those days are the memoirs of Subedar \nSitaram Pande. Sitaram Pande was recruited in 1812 as a sepoy in the \nBengal Native Army. He served the English for 48 years and retired in \n1860. He helped the British to suppress the uprising though his own \nson was a rebel and was killed by the British in front of his eyes. On \nretirement he was persuaded by his Commanding Officer, Norgate, to write \nhis memoirs. He completed the writing in 1861 in Awadhi and Norgate \ntranslated it into English and had it published under the title From Sepoy \nto Subedar.\nHere is an excerpt from what Sitaram Pande wrote:\nIt is my humble opinion that this seizing of Oudh filled the minds of the \nSepoys with distrust and led them to plot against the Government. Agents \nof the Nawab of Oudh and also of the King of Delhi were sent all over \nIndia to discover the temper of the army. They worked upon the feelings of \nsepoys, telling them how treacherously the foreigners had behaved towards \ntheir king. They invented ten thousand lies and promises to persuade the \nsoldiers to mutiny and turn against their masters, the English, with the \nobject of restoring the Emperor of Delhi to the throne. They maintained \nthat this was wholly within the army’s powers if the soldiers would only \nact together and do as they were advised. \nSource 2\nFig. 3 – Rebel sepoys at Meerut attack officers, enter their homes and set fire to buildings\nSource 2 contd.\nReprint 2024-25\nwhen people revolt         55\nIt chanced that about this time the Sarkar sent \nparties of men from each regiment to different \ngarrisons for instructions in the use of the new rifle. \nThese men performed the new drill for some time \nuntil a report got about by some means or the other, \nthat the cartridges used for these new rifles were \ngreased with the fat of cows and pigs. The men from \nour regiment wrote to others in the regiment telling \nthem about this, and there was soon excitement in \nevery regiment. Some men pointed out that in forty \nyears’ service nothing had ever been done by the \nSarkar to insult their religion, but as I have already \nmentioned the sepoys’ minds had been inflamed by \nthe seizure of Oudh. Interested parties were quick \nto point out that the great aim of the English was to \nturn us all into Christians, and they had therefore \nintroduced the cartridge in order to bring this about, \nsince both Mahommedans and Hindus would be \ndefiled by using it.\nThe Colonel sahib was of the opinion that the \nexcitement, which even he could not fail to see, would \npass off, as it had done before, and he recommended \nme to go to my home.\nSitaram Pande, From Sepoy to Subedar, pp. 162-63.\nA Mutiny Becomes a Popular Uprising\nThough struggles between rulers and the ruled are \nnot unusual, sometimes such struggles become quite \nwidespread as a popular resistance so that the power \nof the state breaks down. A very large number of \npeople begin to believe that they have a common enemy \nand rise up against the enemy at the same time. For \nsuch a situation to develop, people have to organise, \ncommunicate, take initiative and display the confidence \nto turn the situation around. \nSuch a situation developed in the northern parts of \nIndia in 1857. After a hundred years of conquest and \nadministration, the English East India Company faced a \nmassive uprising that started in May 1857 and threatened \nthe Company’s very presence in India. Sepoys mutinied in \nseveral places beginning from Meerut and a large number \nof people from different sections of society rose up in \nrebellion. Some regard it as the biggest armed resistance \nto colonialism in the nineteenth century anywhere in the \nworld. \n1. What were the \nimportant concerns \nin the minds of the \npeople according to \nSitaram and according \nto Vishnubhatt? \n2. What role did they \nthink the rulers were \nplaying? What role did \nthe sepoys seem to \nplay? \nActivity\n\nMutiny – When soldiers \nas a group disobey their \nofficers in the army \nSource 2 contd.\nReprint 2024-25\n56\t\nOUR PASTS – III\nFrom Meerut to Delhi\nOn 8 April 1857, a young soldier, Mangal Pandey, was hanged \nto death for attacking his officers in Barrackpore. Some days \nlater, some sepoys of the regiment at Meerut refused to do the \narmy drill using the new cartridges, which were suspected \nof being coated with the fat of cows and pigs. Eighty-five \nsepoys were dismissed from service and sentenced to ten \nyears in jail for disobeying their officers. This happened on \n9 May 1857.\nThe response of the other Indian soldiers in Meerut was \nquite extraordinary. On 10 May, the soldiers marched to the \njail in Meerut and released the imprisoned sepoys. They \nattacked and killed British officers. They captured guns and \nammunition and set fire to the buildings and properties of the \nBritish and declared war on the firangis. The soldiers were \ndetermined to bring an end to their rule in the country. But \nwho would rule the land instead? The soldiers had an answer \nto this question – the Mughal emperor Bahadur Shah Zafar. \nThe sepoys of Meerut rode all night of 10 May to reach \nDelhi in the early hours next morning. As news of their \narrival spread, the regiments stationed in Delhi also rose \nup in rebellion. Again british officers were killed, arms \nand ammunition seized, buildings set on fire. Triumphant \nsoldiers gathered around the walls of the Red Fort where the \nBadshah lived, demanding to meet him. The emperor was not \nquite willing to challenge the mighty British power but the \nsoldiers persisted. They forced their way into the palace and \nproclaimed Bahadur Shah Zafar as their leader. \nFirangis – Foreigners \nThe term reflects an \nattitude of contempt. \nFig. 4 – The battle in the \ncavalry lines\nOn the evening of 3 July \n1857, over 3,000 rebels came \nfrom Bareilly, crossed the \nriver Jamuna, entered Delhi, \nand attacked the British \ncavalry posts. The battle \ncontinued all through \nthe night.\nFig. 5 – Postal stamp issued in \ncommemoration of Mangal Pandey\nReprint 2024-25\nwhen people revolt         57\nThe ageing emperor had to accept this demand. He wrote \nletters to all the chiefs and rulers of the country to come \nforward and organise a confederacy of Indian states to fight \nthe British. This single step taken by Bahadur Shah had \ngreat implications.\nThe Mughal dynasty had ruled over a very large \npart of the country. Most smaller rulers and chieftains \ncontrolled different territories on behalf of the Mughal \nruler.  Threatened by the expansion of British rule, many \nof them felt that if the Mughal emperor could rule again, \nthey too would be able to rule their own territories once \nmore, under Mughal authority.  \nThe British had not expected this to happen. They thought \nthe disturbance caused by the issue of the cartridges would die \ndown. But Bahadur Shah Zafar’s decision to bless the uprising \nchanged the entire situation dramatically. Often when people \nsee an alternative possibility, they feel inspired and enthused. \nIt gives them the courage, hope and confidence to act.\nThe uprising spreads\nAfter the British were routed from Delhi, there was no uprising \nfor almost a week. It took that much time for news to travel. \nThen, a spurt of mutinies began. \nRegiment after regiment mutinied and took off to join \nother troops at nodal points like Delhi, Kanpur and Lucknow. \nAfter them, the people of the towns and villages also rose \nup in rebellion and rallied around local leaders, zamindars \nand chiefs who were prepared to establish their authority \nand fight the British. Nana Saheb, the adopted son of the \nlate Peshwa Baji Rao who lived near Kanpur, gathered \narmed forces and expelled the British garrison from the \ncity. He proclaimed himself Peshwa. He declared that \nhe was a governor under Emperor Bahadur Shah Zafar. \nIn Lucknow, Birjis Qadr, \nthe son of  the deposed \nNawab Wajid Ali Shah, was \nproclaimed the new Nawab. \nHe too acknowledged the \nsuzerainty of Bahadur \nShah Zafar. His mother \nBegum Hazrat Mahal \ntook an active part in \norganising the uprising \nagainst the British. In \nJhansi, Rani Lakshmibai \njoined the rebel sepoys and  \nfought the British along \nwith Tantia Tope, the \nFig. 8 – As the mutiny spread, \nBritish officers were killed in \nthe cantonments\nFig. 6 – Bahadur Shah Zafar \nFig. 7 – Rani Laxmibai \nReprint 2024-25\n58\t\nOUR PASTS – III\ngeneral of Nana Saheb. In the Mandla region of Madhya \nPradesh, Rani Avantibai Lodhi of Ramgarh raised and \nled an army of four thousand against the British who \nhad taken over the administration of her state. \nThe British were greatly outnumbered by the rebel forces. \nThey were defeated in a number of battles. This convinced \nthe people that the rule of the British had collapsed for good \nand gave them the confidence to take the plunge and join \nthe uprising. A situation of widespread popular uprising \ndeveloped in the region of Awadh in particular. On 6 August \n1857, we find a telegram sent by Lieutenant Colonel Tytler \nto his Commander-in-Chief expressing the fear felt by the \nBritish: “Our men are cowed by the numbers opposed   to \nthem and the endless fighting. Every village is held against \nus, the zamindars have risen to oppose us.”\nMany new leaders came up. For example,  Ahmadullah \nShah, a maulvi from Faizabad, prophesied that the rule \nof the British would come to an end soon. He caught \nthe imagination of the people and raised a huge force of \nsupporters. He came to Lucknow to fight the British. In Delhi, \na large number of ghazis or religious warriors came together \nto wipe out the white people. Bakht Khan, a soldier from \nBareilly, took charge of a large force of fighters who came \nto Delhi. He became a key military leader of the uprising. \nIn Bihar, an old zamindar, Kunwar Singh, joined the rebel \nsepoys and battled with the British for many months. \nLeaders and fighters from across the land joined the fight. \nThe Company Fights Back\nUnnerved by the scale of the upheaval, the Company \ndecided to repress the revolt with all its might. It brought \nreinforcements from England, passed new laws so that \nFig. 11 – British forces attack \nthe rebels who had occupied \nthe Red Fort (on the right) and \nSalimgarh Fort in Delhi (on the \nleft)\nActivity\n1.\t Why did the Mughal \nemperor agree to \nsupport the rebels? \n2. \tWrite a paragraph on \nthe assessment he \nmay have made before \naccepting the offer of \nthe sepoys. \n\nFig. 9 – A portrait of Nana Saheb \nFig. 10 – \nA portrait of Vir Kunwar Singh\nReprint 2024-25\nwhen people revolt         59\nthe rebels could be convicted with ease, and then moved \ninto the storm centres of the revolt. Delhi was recaptured \nfrom the rebel forces in September 1857. The last Mughal \nemperor, Bahadur Shah Zafar was tried in court and \nsentenced to life imprisonment. He and his wife Begum \nZinat Mahal were sent to prison in Rangoon in October \n1858. Bahadur Shah Zafar died in the Rangoon jail in \nNovember 1862.\nThe recapture of Delhi, however, did not mean that the \nuprising died down after that. People continued to resist and \nbattle the British. The British had to fight for two years to \nsuppress the massive forces of popular uprising. \nLucknow was taken in  March 1858. Rani Lakshmibai \nwas defeated and killed in June 1858. A similar fate \nawaited Rani Avantibai, who after initial victory in Kheri, \nchose to embrace death when surrounded by the British on \nall sides. Tantia Tope escaped to the jungles of central India \nand continued to fight a guerrilla war with the support of \nmany tribal and peasant leaders. He was captured, tried \nand killed in April 1859.\nJust as victories against the British had earlier \nencouraged uprising, the defeat of rebel forces \nencouraged desertions. The British also tried their best \nto win back the loyalty of the people. They announced \nrewards for loyal landholders would be allowed to \ncontinue to enjoy traditional rights over their lands. \nThose who had rebelled were told that if they submitted \nto the British, and if they had not killed any white people, \nActivity\nMake a list of places \nwhere the uprising took \nplace in May, June and \nJuly 1857.\n\nFig. 12– The siege train reaches \nDelhi \nThe British forces initially found \nit difficult to break through the \nheavy fortification in Delhi.

Nevertheless, hundreds of \nsepoys, rebels, nawabs and rajas were tried and hanged. \nAftermath\nThe British had regained control \nof the country by the end of 1859, \nbut they could not carry on ruling \nthe land with the same policies \nany more. \nGiven below are the important \nchanges that were introduced by \nthe British. \n1. The British Parliament passed \na new Act in 1858 and transferred the \npowers of the East India Company to \nthe British Crown in  order to ensure \na more responsible management \nof Indian affairs. A member of the \nBritish Cabinet was appointed Secretary of State for \nIndia and made responsible for all matters related to the \ngovernance of India. He was given a council to advise \nhim, called the India Council. The Governor-General of \nIndia was given the title of Viceroy, that is, a personal \nrepresentative of the Crown. Through these measures, \nthe British government accepted direct responsibility for \nruling India.\nFig. 14 – British troops blow up \nKashmere Gate to enter Delhi \nFig. 15 – British forces capture \nthe rebels near Kanpur\nNotice the way the artist shows \nthe British soldiers valiantly \nadvancing on the rebel forces.\nReprint 2024-25\nwhen people revolt         61\n2.\t All ruling chiefs of the country were assured that their territory \nwould never be annexed in future. They were allowed to pass on \ntheir kingdoms to their heirs, including adopted sons. However, they \nwere made to acknowledge the British Queen as their Sovereign \nParamount. Thus the Indian rulers were to hold their kingdoms as \nsubordinates of the British Crown.\n3.\t It was decided that the proportion of Indian soldiers in the army \nwould be reduced and the number of European soldiers would be \nincreased. It was also decided that instead of recruiting soldiers from \nAwadh, Bihar, central India and south India, more soldiers would be \nrecruited from among the Gurkhas, Sikhs and Pathans. \n4.\t The land and property of Muslims was confiscated on a large \nscale and they were treated with suspicion and hostility. The British \nbelieved that they were responsible for the uprising in a big way.\n5.\t The British decided to respect the customary religious and \nsocial practices of the people in India.\n6.\t Policies were made to protect landlords and zamindars and \ngive them security of rights over their lands. \nThus a new phase of history began after 1857.\nFig. 16 – Some \nimportant centres of \nthe Revolt in North \nIndia\nMain centres of the Revolt\nOther centres of the Revolt \n\n\nReprint 2024-25\n62\t\nOUR PASTS – III\nThe Khurda Uprising – A Case Study\nMuch before the event of 1857, there had taken place another event of a similar nature at \na place called Khurda in 1817. Here, it would be instructive for us to study that event and \nreflect on how resentment against the colonial policies of the British had been building up \nsince the beginning of the 19th century in different parts of the country.\nKhurda, a small kingdom built up in the late 16th century in the south-eastern part of \nOrissa, was a populous and well-cultivated territory consisting of 105 garhs, 60 large and \n1109 small villages at the beginning of the 19th century. Its king, Raja Birakishore Dev had \nto earlier give up the possession of four parganas, the superintendence of the Jagannath \nTemple and the administration of fourteen garjats (Princely States) to the Marathas under \ncompulsion. His son and successor, Mukunda Dev II was greatly disturbed with this loss of \nfortune. Therefore, sensing an opportunity in the Anglo-Maratha conflict, he had entered into \nnegotiations with the British to get back his lost territories and the rights over the Jagannath \nTemple. But after the occupation of Orissa in 1803, the British showed no inclination to \noblige him on either score. Consequently, in alliance with other feudatory chiefs of Orissa \nand secret support of the Marathas, he tried to assert his rights by force. This led to his \ndeposition and annexation of his territories by the British. As a matter of consolation, he \nwas only given the rights of management of the Jagannath Temple with a grant amounting \nto a mere one-tenth of the revenue of his former estate and his residence was fixed at Puri. \nThis unfair settlement commenced an era of oppressive foreign rule in Orissa, which paved \nthe way for a serious armed uprising in 1817.\nSoon after taking over Khurda, the British followed a policy of resuming service \ntenures.  It bitterly affected the lives of the ex-militia of the state, the Paiks.  The severity of \nthe measure was compounded on account of an unreasonable increase in the demand of \nrevenue and also the oppressive ways of its collection.  Consequently, there was large scale \ndesertion of people from Khurda between 1805 and 1817. Yet, the British went for a series of  \nshort-term settlements, each time increasing the demands, not recognising either the \nproductive capacity of the land or the paying capacity of the ryots.  No leniency was shown \neven in case of natural calamities, which Orissa was frequently prone to.  Rather, lands of \ndefaulters were sold off to scheming revenue officials or speculators from Bengal.  \nThe hereditary Military Commander of the deposed king, Jagabandhu Bidyadhar \nMahapatra Bhramarabar Rai or Buxi Jagabandhu as he was popularly known, was one among \nthe dispossessed land-holders.  He had in effect become a beggar, and for nearly two years \nsurvived on voluntary contributions from the people of Khurda before deciding to fight for \ntheir grievances as well as his own.   Over the years, what had added to these grievances \nwere (a) the introduction of sicca rupee (silver currency) in the region, (b) the insistence \non payment of revenue in the new currency, (c) an unprecedented rise in the prices of  \nfood-stuff and salt, which had become far-fetched following the introduction of salt monopoly \nbecause of which the traditional salt makers of Orissa were deprived of making salt, and  \n(d) the auction of local estates in Calcutta, which brought in absentee landlords from Bengal \nto Orissa. Besides, the insensitive and corrupt police system also made the situation worse \nfor the armed uprising to take a sinister shape.\nThe uprising was set off on 29 March 1817 as the Paiks attacked the police station and \nother government establishments at Banpur killing more than a hundred men and took \naway a large amount of government money.  Soon its ripples spread in different directions \nwith Khurda becoming its epicenter.  The zamindars and ryots alike joined the Paiks with \nenthusiasm. Those who did not, were taken to task. A ‘no-rent campaign’ was also started. \nThe British tried to dislodge the Paiks from their entrenched position but failed. On 14 April \n1817, Buxi Jagabandhu, leading five to ten thousand Paiks and men of the Kandh tribe \nReprint 2024-25\nwhen people revolt         63\nseized Puri and declared the hesitant king, Mukunda Dev II as their ruler.  The priests of \nthe Jagannath Temple also extended the Paiks their full support.  \nSeeing the situation going out of hand, the British clamped Martial Law. The King \nwas quickly captured and sent to prison in Cuttack with his son.  The Buxi with his close \nassociate, Krushna Chandra Bhramarabar Rai, tried to cut off all communications between \nCuttack and Khurda as the uprising spread to the southern and the north-western parts of \nOrissa.  Consequently, the British sent Major-General Martindell to clear off the area from \nthe clutches of the Paiks while at the same time announcing rewards for the arrest of Buxi \nJagabandhu and his associates.  In the ensuing operation, hundreds of Paiks were killed, \nmany fled to deep jungles and some returned home under a scheme of amnesty.  Thus by \nMay 1817, the uprising was mostly contained.\nHowever, outside Khurda it was sustained by Buxi Jagabandhu with the help of \nsupporters like the Raja of Kujung and the unflinching loyalty of the Paiks until his surrender \nin May 1825.  On their part, the British henceforth adopted a policy of ‘leniency, indulgence \nand forbearance’ towards the people of Khurda.  The price of salt was reduced and necessary \nreforms were made in the police and the justice systems.  Revenue officials found to be \ncorrupt were dismissed from service and former land-holders were restored to their lands. \nThe son of the king of Khurda, Ram Chandra Dev III was allowed to move to Puri and take \ncharge of the affairs of the Jagannath Temple with a grant of rupees twenty-four thousand. \nIn sum, it was the first such popular anti-British armed uprising in Orissa, which had \nfar reaching effect on the future of British administration in that part of the country. \nTo merely call it a ‘Paik Rebellion’ will thus be an understatement.\nLet’s recall\n1.\t What was the demand of Rani Lakshmibai of Jhansi \nthat was refused by the British?\n2.\t What did the British do to protect the interests of \nthose who converted to Christianity? \n3.\t What objections did the sepoys have to the new \ncartridges that they were asked to use?\n4.\t How did the last Mughal emperor live the last years \nof his life?\nLet’s imagine\nImagine you are a \nBritish officer in Awadh \nduring the rebellion. \nWhat would you do \nto keep your plans of \nfighting the rebels a  \ntop secret?\nReprint 2024-25\n64\t\nOUR PASTS – III\nFig. 17 – Ruins of the Residency \nin Lucknow\nIn June 1857, the rebel forces \nbegan the siege of the Residency. \nA large number of British women, \nmen and children had taken \nshelter in the buildings there.  \nThe rebels surrounded the \ncompound and bombarded the \nbuilding with shells.

    "text": "Tribals, Dikus and the \nVision of a Golden Age\n4\nIn 1895, a man named Birsa was seen roaming the forests and \nvillages of Chottanagpur in Jharkhand. People said he had \nmiraculous powers – he could cure all diseases and multiply \ngrain. Birsa himself declared that God had appointed him \nto save his people from trouble, free them from the slavery \nof dikus (outsiders). Soon thousands began following Birsa, \nbelieving that he was bhagwan (God) and had come to solve \nall their problems.\nBirsa was born in a family of Mundas – a tribal group \nthat lived in Chottanagpur. But his followers included \nother tribals of the region – Santhals and Oraons. All of \nthem in different ways were unhappy with the changes \nthey were experiencing and the problems they were facing \nunder British rule. Their familiar ways of life seemed to be \ndisappearing, their livelihoods were under \nthreat, and their religion appeared to be \nin danger. \nWhat problems did Birsa set out to resolve? \nWho were the outsiders being referred to as \ndikus, and how did they enslave the people of \nthe region? What was happening to the tribal \npeople under the British? How did their lives \nchange? These are some of the questions you \nwill read about in this chapter.\nYou have read about tribal societies last \nyear. Most tribes had customs and rituals \nthat were very different from those laid \ndown by Brahmans. These societies also \ndid not have the sharp social divisions \nthat were characteristic of caste societies. \nAll those who belonged to the same tribe \nthought of themselves as sharing common \nties of kinship. However, this did not mean \nthat there were no social and economic \ndifferences within tribes.\nFig. 1 – Women of the \nDongria Kandha tribe \nin Orissa wade through  \nthe river on the way to \nthe market\nReprint 2024-25\n40\t\nOUR PASTS – III\nHow did Tribal Groups Live?\nBy the nineteenth century, tribal people in different parts \nof India were involved in a variety of activities. \nSome were jhum cultivators\nSome of them practised jhum cultivation, that is, shifting \ncultivation. This was done on small patches of land, mostly \nin forests. The cultivators cut the treetops to allow sunlight \nto reach the ground, and burnt the vegetation on the land \nto clear it for cultivation. They spread the ash from the \nfiring, which contained potash, to fertilise the soil. They \nused the axe to cut trees and the hoe to scratch the soil \nin order to prepare it for cultivation. They broadcast the \nseeds, that is, scattered the seeds on the field instead of \nploughing the land  and sowing the seeds. Once the crop \nwas ready and harvested, they moved to another field. \nA field that had been cultivated once was left fallow for \nseveral years, \nShifting cultivators were found in the hilly and forested \ntracts of north-east and central India. The lives of  these \ntribal people depended on free movement within forests \nand on being able to use the land and forests for growing \ntheir crops. That is the only way they could practise \nshifting cultivation.  \nSome were hunters and gatherers\nIn many regions, tribal groups lived by hunting \nanimals and gathering forest produce. They saw forests \nas essential for survival. The Khonds were such a \ncommunity living in the forests of Orissa. They regularly \nwent out on collective hunts and then divided the meat \namongst themselves. \nThey ate fruits and roots \ncollected from the forest \nand cooked food with the \noil they extracted from \nthe seeds of the sal and \nmahua. They used many \nforest shrubs and herbs \nfor medicinal purposes, \nand sold forest produce \nin the local markets. The \nlocal weavers and leather \nworkers turned to the \nKhonds when they needed \nsupplies of kusum and \npalash flowers to colour \ntheir clothes and leather.\nFallow – A field left \nuncultivated for a while \nso that the soil recovers \nfertility\nSal – A tree\nMahua – A flower that \nis eaten or used to make \nalcohol\nFig. 2 – Dongria Kandha women \nin Orissa take home pandanus \nleaves from the forest to make \nplates\nReprint 2024-25\n\t\nTRIBALS, DIKUS AND THE VISION OF A GOLDEN AGE          41\nFrom where did these forest \npeople get their supplies of rice \nand other grains? At times they \nexchanged goods – getting what \nthey needed in return for their \nvaluable forest produce. At other \ntimes, they bought goods with the \nsmall amount of earnings they \nhad. Some of them did odd jobs \nin the villages, carrying loads \nor building roads, while others \nlaboured in the fields of peasants \nand farmers. When supplies of \nforest produce shrank, tribal \npeople had to increasingly wander \naround in search of work as \nlabourers. But many of them – like \nthe Baigas of central India – were \nreluctant to do work for others. \nThe Baigas saw themselves as \npeople of the forest, who could \nonly live on the produce of the \nforest. It was below the dignity of \na Baiga to become a labourer. \nTribal groups often needed \nto buy and sell in order to be \nable to get the goods that were \nnot produced within the locality. This led to their \ndependence on traders and moneylenders. Traders came \naround with things for sale, and sold the goods at high \nprices. Moneylenders gave loans with which the tribals \nmet their cash needs, adding to what they earned. But \nthe interest charged on the loans was usually very \nhigh. So for the tribals, market and commerce often \nmeant debt and poverty. They therefore came to see \nthe moneylender and trader as evil outsiders and the \ncause of their misery. \nSome herded animals\nMany tribal groups lived by herding and rearing animals. \nThey were pastoralists who moved with their herds of \ncattle or sheep according to the seasons.  When the grass \nin one place was exhausted, they moved to another area. \nThe Van Gujjars of the Punjab hills and the Labadis of \nAndhra Pradesh were cattle herders, the Gaddis of Kulu \nwere shepherds, and the Bakarwals of Kashmir reared \ngoats. You will read more about them in your history \nbook next year.\nFig. 3 – Location of some tribal \ngroups in India\nReprint 2024-25\n42\t\nOUR PASTS – III\nA time to hunt, a time to sow, a time to move to a new field\nHave you ever noticed that people living in different types of societies do not \nshare the same notion of work and time? The lives of the shifting cultivators and \nhunters in different regions were regulated by a calendar and division of tasks \nfor men and women. \nVerrier Elwin, a British anthropologist who lived among the Baigas and Khonds \nof central India for many years in the 1930s and 1940s, gives us a picture of what \nthis calendar and division of tasks was like. He writes:  \nIn Chait women went to clearings to ... cut stalks that were already reaped; \nmen cut large trees and go for their ritual hunt. The hunt began at full \nmoon from the east. Traps of bamboo were used for hunting. The women \ngathered fruits like sago, tamarind and mushroom. Baiga women can only \ngather roots or kanda and mahua seeds. Of all the adivasis in  Central India, the \nBaigas were known as the best hunters … In Baisakh the firing of the forest \ntook place, the women gathered unburnt wood to burn. Men continued \nto hunt, but nearer their villages. In Jeth sowing took place and hunting \nstill went on. From Asadh to Bhadon the men worked in the fields. In Kuar \nthe first fruits of beans were ripened and in Kartik kutki became ripe. In \nAghan every crop was ready and in Pus winnowing took place. Pus was also \nthe time for dances and marriages. In \nMagh shifts were made to new bewars \nand hunting-gathering was the main \nsubsistence activity. \nThe cycle described above took \nplace in the first year. In the second \nyear there was more time for hunting \nas only a few crops had to be sown \nand harvested. But since there was \nenough food the men lived in the \nbewars. It was only in the third year \nthat the diet had to be supplemented \nwith the forest products.\nAdapted from Verrier Elwin, Baiga (1939) and Elwin’s \nunpublished ‘Notes on the Khonds’ (Verrier Elwin \nPapers, Nehru Memorial Museum and Library)\nSource 1\nFig. 4 – A Santhal girl carrying firewood, \nBihar, 1946\nChildren go with their mothers to the forest \nto gather forest produce.\nActivity\nLook carefully at the tasks that Baiga \nmen and women did.

They began \nto use the plough, and gradually got rights over the \nland they lived on. In many cases, like the Mundas of \nChottanagpur, the land belonged to the clan as a whole. \nAll members of the clan were regarded as descendants \nof the original settlers, who had first cleared the land. \nTherefore, all of them had rights on the land. Very \noften some people within the clan acquired more power \nthan others, some became chiefs and others followers. \nPowerful men often rented out their land instead of \ncultivating it themselves.\nBritish officials saw settled tribal groups like the Gonds \nand Santhals as more civilised than hunter-gatherers or \nshifting cultivators. Those who lived in the forests were \nconsidered to be wild and savage: they needed to be settled \nand civilised. \nHow did Colonial Rule Affect Tribal \nLives?\nThe lives of tribal groups changed during British rule. Let \nus see what these changes were.\nWhat happened to tribal chiefs?\nBefore the arrival of the British, in many areas the tribal \nchiefs were important people. They enjoyed a certain \namount of economic power and had the right to administer \nand control their territories. In some places they had \ntheir own police and decided on the local rules of land \nand forest management. Under British rule, the functions \nand powers of the tribal chiefs changed considerably. \nThey were allowed to keep their land titles over a cluster \nof villages and rent out lands, but they lost much of their \nadministrative power and were forced to follow laws made \nby British officials in India. They also had to pay tribute \nto the British, and discipline the tribal groups on behalf \nof the British. They lost the authority they had earlier \nenjoyed amongst their people, and were unable to fulfil \ntheir traditional functions.\nWhat happened to the shifting cultivators?\nThe British were uncomfortable with groups who moved \nabout and did not have a fixed home. They wanted tribal \nBewar – A term used           \nin Madhya Pradesh for \nshifting cultivation\nFig. 5 – A log house being built \nin a village of the Nyishi tribes of  \nArunachal Pradesh.\nThe entire village helps when log \nhuts are built.\nReprint 2024-25\n44\t\nOUR PASTS – III\ngroups to settle down and become peasant cultivators. \nSettled peasants were easier to control and administer \nthan people who were always on the move. The British \nalso wanted a regular revenue source for the state. \nSo they introduced land settlements – that is, they \nmeasured the land, defined the rights of each individual \nto that land, and fixed the revenue demand for the \nstate. Some peasants were declared landowners, others \ntenants. As you have seen (Chapter 2), the tenants were \nto pay rent to the landowner who in turn paid revenue \nto the state.\nThe British effort to settle jhum cultivators was not \nvery successful. Settled plough cultivation is not easy in \nareas where water is scarce and the soil is dry. In fact, \njhum cultivators who took to plough cultivation often \nsuffered, since their fields did not produce good yields. \nSo the jhum cultivators in north-east India insisted \non continuing with their traditional practice. Facing \nwidespread protests, the British had to ultimately allow \nthem the right to carry on shifting cultivation in some \nparts of the forest.\nFig. 6 – Bhil women cultivating in \na forest in Gujarat\nShifting cultivation continues \nin many forest areas of Gujarat. \nYou can see that trees have been \ncut and land cleared to create \npatches for cultivation.\nFig. 7 – Tribal workers in a rice field in Andhra Pradesh\nNote the difference between rice cultivation in the flat plains and in \nthe forests.\nReprint 2024-25\n\t\nTRIBALS, DIKUS AND THE VISION OF A GOLDEN AGE          45\nForest laws and their impact\nThe life of tribal groups, as you have seen, was directly \nconnected to the forest. So changes in forest laws had a \nconsiderable effect on tribal lives. The British extended \ntheir control over all forests and declared that forests were \nstate property. Some forests were classified as Reserved \nForests for they produced timber which the British wanted. \nIn these forests people were not allowed to move freely, \npractise jhum cultivation, collect fruits, or hunt animals. \nHow were jhum cultivators to survive in such a situation? \nMany were therefore forced to move to other areas in search \nof work and livelihood. \nBut once the British stopped the tribal people from \nliving inside forests, they faced a problem. From where \nwould the Forest Department get its labour to cut trees \nfor railway sleepers and to transport logs?\nColonial officials came up with a solution. They decided \nthat they would give jhum cultivators small patches of land \nin the forests and allow them to cultivate these on the \ncondition that those who lived in the villages would have \nto provide labour to the Forest Department and look after \nthe forests. So in many regions, the Forest Department \nestablished forest villages to ensure a regular supply of \ncheap labour.\n“In this land of the English how hard it is to live”\nIn the1930s Verrier Elwin visited the land of the Baigas – a tribal group in \ncentral India. He wanted to know about them – their customs and practices, \ntheir art and folklore.

They disobeyed the \nnew rules, continued with practices that \nwere declared illegal, and at times rose \nin open rebellion. Such was the revolt of \nSongram Sangma in 1906  in Assam, and \nthe forest satyagraha of the 1930s in the \nCentral Provinces.\nThe problem with trade\nDuring the nineteenth century, tribal \ngroups found that traders and money-\nlenders were coming into the forests more \noften, wanting to buy forest produce, \noffering cash loans, and asking them to \nwork for wages. It took tribal groups some \ntime to understand the consequences of \nwhat was happening.\nLet us consider the case of the silk \ngrowers. In the eighteenth century, Indian \nsilk was in demand in European markets. \nThe fine quality of Indian silk was highly \nvalued and exports from India increased \nrapidly. As the market expanded, East India Company \nofficials tried to encourage silk production to meet the \ngrowing demand. \nHazaribagh, in present-day Jharkhand, was an area \nwhere the Santhals reared cocoons. The \ntraders dealing in silk sent in their agents \nwho gave loans to the tribal people and \ncollected the cocoons. The growers \nwere paid ` 3 to ` 4 for a thousand \ncocoons. These were then \nexported to Burdwan or \nGaya where they were \nsold at five times the \nprice. The middlemen \n– so called because \nthey arranged deals \nbetween the exporters \nand silk growers – made \nhuge profits. The silk \ngrowers earned very \nlittle. Understandably, \nmany tribal groups saw \nthe market and the \ntraders as their main \nenemies.  \nFig. 9 – A Hajang \nwoman weaving a mat\nFor women, domestic \nwork was not confined \nto the home.

From the late nineteenth \ncentury, tea plantations started coming up and mining became \nan important industry. Tribals were recruited in large numbers \nto work at the tea plantations of Assam and the coal mines \nof Jharkhand. They were recruited through contractors who \npaid them miserably low wages, and prevented them from \nreturning home.\nA Closer Look\nThrough the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, tribal groups \nin different parts of the country rebelled against the changes \nin laws, the restrictions on their practices, the new taxes they \nhad to pay, and the exploitation by traders and moneylenders. \nThe Kols rebelled in 1831–32, Santhals rose in revolt in 1855, \nthe Bastar Rebellion in central India broke out in 1910 and the \nWarli Revolt in Maharashtra in 1940. The movement that Birsa \nled was one such movement.\nFig. 10 – Coal miners of \nBihar, 1948\nIn the 1920s, about 50 per \ncent of the miners in the \nJharia and Raniganj coal \nmines of Bihar were tribals. \nWork deep down in the dark \nand suffocating mines was \nnot only back-breaking \nand dangerous, it was \noften literally killing.

The son of a poor father, \nhe grew up around the forests of Bohonda, grazing sheep, \nplaying the flute, and dancing in the local akhara. Forced \nby poverty, his father had to move from place to place \nlooking for work. As an adolescent, Birsa heard tales of \nthe Munda uprisings of the past and saw the sirdars \n(leaders) of the community urging the people to revolt. \nThey talked of a golden age when the Mundas had been \nfree of the oppression of dikus, and said there would be \na time when the ancestral right of the community would \nbe restored. They saw themselves as the descendants of \nthe original settlers of the region, fighting for their land \n(mulk ki larai), reminding people of the need to win back \ntheir kingdom.\nBirsa went to the local missionary school, and listened \nto the sermons of missionaries. There too he heard it said \nthat it was possible for the Mundas to attain the Kingdom \nof Heaven, and regain their lost rights. This would be \npossible if they became good Christians and gave up their \n“bad practices”. Later Birsa also spent some time in the \ncompany of a prominent Vaishnav preacher. He wore the \nsacred thread, and began to value the importance of purity \nand piety.\nBirsa was deeply influenced by many of the ideas he \ncame in touch with in his growing-up years. His movement \nwas aimed at reforming tribal society. He urged the Mundas \nto give up drinking liquor, clean their village, and stop \nbelieving in witchcraft and sorcery. But we must remember \nthat Birsa also turned against missionaries and landlords. \nHe saw them as outside forces that were ruining the Munda \nway of life.\nIn 1895, Birsa urged his followers to recover their \nglorious past. He talked of  a golden age in the past – a \nsatyug (the age of truth) – when Mundas lived a good \nlife, constructed embankments, tapped natural springs, \nplanted trees and orchards, practised cultivation to \nearn their living. They did not kill their brethren and \nrelatives. They lived honestly. Birsa also wanted people \nto once again work on their land, settle down and \ncultivate their fields. \nWhat worried British officials most was the political \naim of the Birsa movement, for it wanted to drive \nout missionaries, moneylenders, landlords, and the \ngovernment and set up a Munda Raj with Birsa at \nits head. The movement identified all these forces as \nthe cause of the misery the Mundas were suffering.  \n‘Blood trickles \nfrom my shoulders’\nThe songs the Mundas \nsang bemoaned their \nmisery. \nAlas! \nunder \n[the \ndrudgery of] forced \nlabour\nBlood trickles from \nmy shoulders\nDay and night the \nemissary from the \nzamindars,\nAnnoys and irritates \nme, day and night I \ngroan\nAlas!

They arrested Birsa in 1895, convicted him on charges \nof rioting and jailed him for two years. \nWhen Birsa was released in 1897, he began touring \nthe villages to gather support. He used traditional \nsymbols and language to rouse people, urging them \nto destroy “Ravana” (dikus and the Europeans) and \nestablish a kingdom under his leadership. Birsa’s \nfollowers began targeting the symbols of diku and \nEuropean power. They attacked police stations and \nchurches, and raided the property of moneylenders \nand zamindars. They raised the white flag as a symbol \nof Birsa Raj.  \nIn 1900, Birsa died of cholera and the movement \nfaded out. However, the movement was significant in at \nleast two ways. First – it forced the colonial government to \nintroduce laws so that the land of the tribals could not be \neasily taken over by dikus.

    "text": "Civilising the “Native”, \nEducating the Nation\n6\nIn the earlier chapters, you have seen how British rule affected \nrajas and nawabs, peasants and tribals. In this chapter, we \nwill try and understand what implication it had for the lives of \nstudents. For, the British in India wanted not only territorial \nconquest and control over revenues. They also felt that they had \na cultural mission: they had to “civilise the natives”, change their \ncustoms and values.\nWhat changes were to be introduced? How were Indians \nto be educated, “civilised”, and made into what the British \nbelieved were “good subjects”? The British could find no simple \nanswers to these questions. They continued to be debated for \nmany decades. \nHow the British saw Education\nLet us look at what the British thought and \ndid, and how some of the ideas of education \nthat we now take for granted evolved in the \nlast two hundred years. In the process of this \nenquiry, we will also see how Indians reacted \nto British ideas, and how they developed  \ntheir own views about how Indians were to \nbe educated.\nThe tradition of Orientalism\nIn 1783, a person named William Jones \narrived in Calcutta. He had an appointment \nas a junior judge at the Supreme Court that \nthe Company had set up. In addition to being \nan expert in law, Jones was a linguist. He \nhad studied Greek and Latin at Oxford, knew \nFrench and English, had picked up Arabic \nfrom a friend, and had also learnt Persian. \nAt Calcutta, he began spending many hours \na day with pandits who taught him the \nsubtleties of Sanskrit language, grammar and Fig. 1 – William Jones learning Persian\nLinguist – Someone \nwho knows and  \nstudies several \nlanguages\nReprint 2024-25\n66\t\nOUR PASTS – III\nMadrasa – An Arabic \nword for a place of \nlearning; any type of \nschool or college\npoetry. Soon he was studying ancient Indian texts on \nlaw, philosophy, religion, politics, morality, arithmetic, \nmedicine and the other sciences. \nJones discovered that his interests were shared by many \nBritish officials living in Calcutta at the time. Englishmen \nlike Henry Thomas Colebrooke and Nathaniel Halhed were \nalso busy discovering the ancient Indian heritage, mastering \nIndian languages and translating Sanskrit and Persian works \ninto English. Together with them, Jones set up the Asiatic \nSociety of Bengal, and started a journal called Asiatick \nResearches. \nJones and Colebrooke came to represent a particular \nattitude towards India. They shared a deep respect for \nancient cultures, both of India and the West. Indian \ncivilisation, they felt, had attained its glory in the \nancient past, but had subsequently declined. In order to \nunderstand India, it was necessary to discover the sacred \nand legal texts that were produced in the ancient period. \nFor only those texts could reveal the real ideas and laws \nof the Hindus and Muslims, and only a new study of \nthese texts could form the basis of future development \nin India.\nSo Jones and Colebrooke went about discovering  ancient \ntexts, understanding their meaning, translating them, and \nmaking their findings known to others. This project, they \nbelieved, would not only help the British learn from Indian \nculture, but it would also help Indians rediscover their own \nheritage, and understand the lost glories of their past. In this \nprocess, the British would become the guardians of Indian \nculture as well as its masters. \nInfluenced by such ideas, many Company officials \nargued that the British ought to promote Indian rather \nthan Western learning. They felt that institutions should \nbe set up to encourage the study of ancient Indian texts \nand teach Sanskrit and Persian literature and poetry. The \nofficials also thought that Hindus and Muslims ought to \nbe taught what they were already familiar with, and what \nthey valued and treasured, not subjects that were alien to \nthem. Only then, they believed, could the British hope to \nwin a place in the hearts of the “natives”; only then could \nthe alien rulers expect to be respected by their subjects. \nWith this object in view, a madrasa was set up in \nCalcutta in 1781 to promote the study of Arabic, Persian \nand Islamic law; and the Hindu College was established \nin Benaras in 1791 to encourage the study of ancient \nSanskrit texts that would be useful for the administration \nof the country.\nFig. 2 – Henry Thomas \nColebrooke\nHe was a scholar of Sanskrit \nand ancient sacred writings of \nHinduism.\nReprint 2024-25\nCIVILISING THE “NATIVE”, EDUCATING THE NATION         67\nNot all officials shared these views. Many were very \nstrong in their criticism of the Orientalists. \n“Grave errors of the East”\nFrom the early nineteenth century, many British officials \nbegan to criticise the Orientalist vision of learning. They \nsaid that knowledge of the East was full of errors and \nunscientific thought; Eastern literature was non-serious \nand light-hearted. So they argued that it was wrong \non the part of the British to spend so much effort in \nencouraging the study of Arabic and Sanskrit language \nand literature. \nJames Mill was one of those who attacked the \nOrientalists. The British effort, he declared, should not be \nto teach what the natives wanted, or what they respected, \nin order to please them and “win a place in their heart”. \nThe aim of education ought to be to teach what was useful \nand practical. So Indians should be made familiar with \nthe scientific and technical advances that the West had \nmade, rather than with the poetry and sacred literature \nof the Orient.\nBy the 1830s, the attack on the Orientalists became \nsharper. One of the most outspoken and influential \nof such critics of the time was Thomas Babington \nMacaulay. He saw India as an uncivilised country that \nneeded to be civilised. No branch of Eastern knowledge, \naccording to him could be compared to what England \nhad produced. Who could deny, declared Macaulay, that\nFig. 3 – Monument to Warren Hastings, by \nRichard Westmacott, 1830, now in Victoria \nMemorial in Calcutta\nThis image represents how Orientalists \nthought of British power in India. You will \nnotice that the majestic figure of Hastings, an \nenthusiastic supporter of the Orientalists, is \nplaced between the standing figure of a pandit \non one side and a seated munshi on the \nother side. Hastings and other Orientalists \nneeded Indian scholars to teach them the \n“vernacular” languages, tell them about local \ncustoms and laws, and help  them translate \nand interpret ancient texts. Hastings took \nthe initiative to set up the Calcutta Madrasa, \nand believed that the ancient customs of the \ncountry and Oriental learning ought to be the \nbasis of British rule in India.\nOrientalists – Those with \na scholarly knowledge of \nthe language and culture           \nof Asia\nMunshi – A person who \ncan read, write and teach \nPersian\nVernacular – A term \ngenerally used to refer to \na local language or dialect \nas distinct from what \nis seen as the standard \nlanguage. In colonial \ncountries like India, the \nBritish used the term \nto mark the difference \nbetween the local \nlanguages of everyday \nuse and English – the \nlanguage of the imperial \nmasters.\nReprint 2024-25\n68 \nOUR PASTS – III\n“a single shelf of a good European \nlibrary was worth the whole \nnative literature of India and \nArabia”. He urged that the British \ngovernment in India stop wasting \npublic money in promoting \nOriental learning, for it was of no  \npractical use.\nWith gr eat energy and \npassion, Macaulay emphasised \nthe need to teach the English \nlanguage. He felt that knowledge \nof English would allow Indians to \nread some of the finest  literature \nthe world had produced; it \nwould make them aware of the \ndevelopments in Western science \nand philosophy. Teaching of English could thus be a \nway of civilising people, changing their tastes, values \nand culture. \nFollowing Macaulay’s minute, the English Education \nAct of 1835 was introduced. The decision was to make \nEnglish the medium of instruction for higher education, \nand to stop the promotion of Oriental institutions like  the \nCalcutta Madrasa and Benaras Sanskrit College. These \ninstitutions were seen as “temples of darkness that were \nfalling of themselves into decay”. English textbooks now \nbegan to be produced for schools.\nEducation for commerce\nIn 1854, the Court of Directors of the East India \nCompany in London sent an educational despatch \nto the Governor-General in India. Issued by Charles \nWood, the President of the Board of Control of the \nCompany, it has come to be known as Wood’s Despatch. \nOutlining the educational policy that was to be followed \nin India, it emphasised once again the practical benefits \nof a system of European learning, as opposed to  \nOriental knowledge. \nOne of the practical uses the Despatch pointed to was \neconomic. European learning, it said, would enable Indians \nto recognise the advantages that flow from the expansion of \ntrade and commerce, and make them see the importance \nof developing the resources of the country. Introducing \nthem to European ways of life, would change their tastes \nand desires, and create a demand for British goods, for \nIndians would begin to appreciate and buy things that \nwere produced in Europe.\nFig. 4 – Thomas Babington \nMacaulay in his study\nLanguage of  \nthe wise?\nEmphasising the need to \nteach English, Macaulay \ndeclared:\nAll parties seem to \nbe agreed on one \npoint, that the dialects \ncommonly spoken \namong the natives \n... of India, contain \nneither literary nor \nscientific information, \nand are, moreover, \nso poor and rude \nthat, until they are \nenriched from some \nother quarter, it will \nnot be easy to translate \nany valuable work into \nthem ...\nFrom Thomas Babington Macaulay, \nMinute of 2 February 1835 on  \nIndian Education \nSource 1\nReprint 2024-25\nCIVILISING THE “NATIVE”, EDUCATING THE NATION         69\nWood’s Despatch also argued that European \nlearning would improve the moral character of \nIndians. It would make them truthful and honest, \nand thus supply the Company with civil servants who \ncould be trusted and depended upon. The literature of \nthe East was not only full of grave errors, it could also \nnot instill in people a sense of duty and a commitment \nto work, nor could it develop the skills required \nfor administration.\nFollowing the 1854 Despatch, several measures \nwere introduced by the British. Education departments \nof the government were set up to extend control \nover all matters regarding education. Steps were \ntaken to establish a system of university education. \nIn 1857, while the sepoys rose in revolt in Meerut \nand Delhi, universities were being established in \nCalcutta, Madras and Bombay. Attempts were also \nmade to bring about changes within the system of \nschool education.\nFig. 5 – Bombay University in the nineteenth century\nActivity\nImagine you are living in the 1850s. You hear of \nWood’s Despatch. Write about your reactions. \n\nAn argument \nfor European \nknowledge\nWood’s Despatch of 1854 \nmarked the final triumph of \nthose who opposed Oriental \nlearning. It stated.\nWe must emphatically \ndeclare that the \ne d u c a t i o n  w h i c h \nwe desire to see \nextended in India is \nthat which has for its \nobject the diffusion \nof the improved arts, \nservices, philosophy, \nand literature of \nEurope, in short, \nEuropean knowledge.\nSource 2\nReprint 2024-25\n70\t\nOUR PASTS – III\nThe demand for moral education\nFig. 7 – Serampore College on the banks of the river Hooghly near Calcutta\nFig. 6 – William Carey \nwas a Scottish missionary             \nwho helped establish the \nSerampore Mission \nThe argument for practical education was strongly criticised by \nthe Christian missionaries in India in the nineteenth century. \nThe missionaries felt that education should attempt to improve \nthe moral character of the people, and morality could be \nimproved only through Christian education. \nUntil 1813, the East India Company was opposed to \nmissionary activities in India. It feared that missionary activities \nwould provoke reaction amongst the local population and \nmake them suspicious of British presence in India. Unable to \nestablish an institution within British-controlled territories, the \nmissionaries set up a mission at Serampore in an area under  \nthe control of the Danish East India Company. A printing press \nwas set up in 1800 and a college established in 1818.\nOver the nineteenth century, missionary schools were \nset up all over India. After 1857, however, the British \ngovernment in India was reluctant to directly support \nmissionary education. There was a feeling that any strong \nattack on local customs, practices, beliefs and religious ideas \nmight enrage “native” opinion.  \nReprint 2024-25\nCIVILISING THE “NATIVE”, EDUCATING THE NATION         71\nWhat Happened to the \nLocal Schools? \nDo you have any idea of how \nchildren were taught in pre-\nBritish times? Have you ever \nwondered whether they went \nto schools? And if there were \nschools, what happened to these \nunder British rule?\nThe report of William Adam\nIn the 1830s, William Adam, \na Scottish missionary, toured \nthe districts of Bengal and  \nBihar. He had been asked by \nthe Company to report on the \nprogress of education in vernacular schools. The report Adam \nproduced is interesting. \nAdam found that there were over 1 lakh pathshalas \nin Bengal and Bihar. These were small institutions with \nno more than 20 students each. But the total number of \nchildren being taught in these pathshalas was considerable \n– over 20 lakh. These institutions were set up by wealthy \npeople, or the local community. At times they were started \nby a teacher (guru). \nThe system of education was flexible. Few things \nthat you associate with schools today were present in \nthe pathshalas at the time. There were no fixed fee, no \nprinted books, no separate school building, no benches \nor chairs, no blackboards, no system of separate classes, \nno roll-call registers, no annual examinations, and no \nregular time-table. In some places, classes were held \nunder a banyan tree, in other places in the corner of \na village shop or temple, or at the guru’s home. Fee \ndepended on the income of parents: the rich had to pay \nmore than the poor. Teaching was oral, and the guru \ndecided what to teach, in accordance with the needs \nof the students. Students were not separated out into \ndifferent classes: all of them sat together in one place. \nThe guru interacted separately with groups of children \nwith different levels of learning. \nAdam discovered that this flexible system was suited \nto local needs. For instance, classes were not held during \nharvest time when rural children often worked in the fields. \nThe pathshala started once again when the crops had been \ncut and stored. This meant that even children of peasant \nfamilies could study. \nFig. 8 – A village pathshala \nThis is a painting by a Dutch \npainter, Francois Solvyn, \nwho came to India in the late \neighteenth century.

So \nit allowed the local pathshalas to function without \nmuch interference. After 1854, the Company decided \nto  improve the system of vernacular education. It felt \nthat this could be done by introducing order within the \nsystem, imposing routines, establishing rules, ensuring \nregular inspections. \nHow was this to be done? What measures did \nthe Company undertake? It appointed a number of \ngovernment pandits, each in charge of looking after \nfour to five schools. The task of the pandit was to visit \nthe pathshalas and try and improve the standard of \nteaching. Each guru was asked to submit periodic \nreports and take classes according to a regular \ntimetable. Teaching was now to be based on textbooks \nand learning was to be tested through a system of \nannual examination. Students were asked to pay a \nregular fee, attend regular classes, sit on fixed seats, \nand obey the new rules of discipline.\nPathshalas which accepted the new rules were \nsupported through government grants. Those who were \nunwilling to work within the new system received no \ngovernment support. Over time, gurus who wanted to \nretain their independence found it difficult to compete \nwith the government aided and regulated pathshalas. \nThe new rules and routines had another consequence. \nIn the earlier system, children from poor peasant \nfamilies had been able to go to pathshalas, since the \ntimetable was flexible. The discipline of the new system \ndemanded regular attendance, even during harvest \ntime when children of poor families had to work in the \nfields. Inability to attend school came to be seen as \nindiscipline, as evidence of the lack of desire to learn.\nThe Agenda for a National Education\nBritish officials were not the only people thinking \nabout education in India. From the early nineteenth \ncentury, many thinkers from different parts of \nIndia began to talk of the need for a wider spread of \neducation. Impressed with the developments in Europe, \nsome Indians felt that Western education would help \nmodernise India. They urged the British to open more \nschools, colleges and universities, and spend more \nmoney on education. You will read about some of \nthese efforts in Chapter 8. There were other Indians, \nActivity\n1.\t Imagine you were born \nin a poor family in the \n1850s. How would you \nhave responded to the \ncoming of the new \nsystem of government-\nregulated pathshalas? \n2.\t Did you know that \nabout 50 per cent of \nthe children going to \nprimary school drop out \nof school by the time \nthey are 13 or 14? Can \nyou think of the various \npossible reasons for \nthis fact?\n\nIn a speech delivered on \nJanuary 15, 1908 in Bombay, \nAurobindo Ghose stated that \nthe goal of national education \nwas to awaken the spirit \nof nationality among the \nstudents.  This required a \ncontemplation of the heroic \ndeeds of our ancestors.  The \neducation should be imparted \nin the vernacular so as to \nreach the largest number of \npeople.  Aurobindo Ghose \nemphasised that although \nthe students should remain \nconnected to their own \nroots, they should also take \nthe fullest advantage of \nmodern scientific discoveries \nand Western experiments \nin popular governments.  \nMoreover, the students should \nalso learn some useful crafts so \nthat they could be able to find \nsome moderately remunerative \nemployment after leaving their \nschools.\nFig. 9 – Sri Aurobindo Ghose\nReprint 2024-25\nCIVILISING THE “NATIVE”, EDUCATING THE NATION         73\nhowever, who reacted against Western education. \nMahatma Gandhi and Rabindranath Tagore were two \nsuch individuals.\nLet us look at what they had to say.\n“English education has enslaved us”\nMahatma Gandhi argued that colonial education created a \nsense of inferiority in the minds of Indians. It made them \nsee Western civilisation as superior, and destroyed the \npride they had in their own culture. There was poison in \nthis education, said Mahatma Gandhi, it was sinful, it \nenslaved Indians, it cast an evil spell on them. Charmed \nby the West, appreciating everything that came from \nthe West, Indians educated in these institutions began \nadmiring British rule. Mahatma Gandhi wanted an \neducation that could help Indians recover their sense of \ndignity and self-respect. During the national movement, \nhe urged students to leave educational institutions in \norder to show to the British that Indians were no longer \nwilling to be enslaved.\nMahatma Gandhi strongly felt that Indian languages \nought to be the medium of teaching. Education in English \ncrippled Indians, distanced them from their own social \nsurroundings, and made them “strangers in their own \nlands”. Speaking a foreign tongue, despising local culture, \nthe English educated did not know how to relate to \nthe masses. \nWestern education, Mahatma Gandhi said, focused \non reading and writing rather than oral knowledge; it \nvalued textbooks rather \nthan lived experience and \npractical knowledge. He \nargued that education \nought to develop a person’s \nmind and soul. Literacy – \nor simply learning to read \nand write – by itself did \nnot count as education. \nPeople had to work with \ntheir hands, learn a craft, \nand know how different \nthings operated. This \nwould develop their mind \nand their capacity to \nunderstand.\nFig. 10 – Mahatma Gandhi along \nwith Kasturba Gandhi sitting with \nRabindranath Tagore and a group \nof girls at Santiniketan, 1940\nReprint 2024-25\n74 \nOUR PASTS – III\n“Literacy in itself is not education”\nMahatma Gandhi wrote:\nBy education I mean an all-round drawing out of \nthe best in child and man – body, mind and spirit. \nLiteracy is not the end of education nor even the \nbeginning. It is only one of the means whereby man \nand woman can be educated. Literacy in itself is \nnot education. I would therefore begin the child’s \neducation by teaching it a useful handicraft and \nenabling it to produce from the moment it begins \nits training … I hold that the highest development \nof the mind and the soul is possible under such a \nsystem of education. Only every handicraft has to \nbe taught not merely mechanically as is done today \nbut scientifically, i.e. the child should know the why \nand the wherefore of every process. \nThe Collected Works of Mahatma Gandhi, Vol. 72, p. 79\nAs nationalist sentiments spread, other thinkers \nalso began thinking of a system of national education \nwhich would be radically different from that set up by  \nthe British. \nTagore’s “abode of peace”\nMany of you may have heard of Santiniketan. Do you know \nwhy it was established and by whom? \nRabindranath Tagore started the institution in 1901. \nAs a child, Tagore hated going to school. He found it \nsuffocating and oppressive. The school appeared like a \nprison, for he could never do what he felt like doing. So \nwhile other children listened to the \nteacher, Tagore’s mind would \nwander away. \nThe experience of his \nschooldays in Calcutta \nshaped Tagore’s ideas \nof education. On growing \nup, he wanted to set \nup a school where \nthe child was happy, \nwhere she could be free \nand creative, where she \nwas able to explore her own \nthoughts and desires. Tagore felt  \nSource 3\nFig. 11 – A class in progress in \nSantiniketan in the 1930s\nNotice the surroundings – the \ntrees and the open spaces.  \nReprint 2024-25\nCIVILISING THE “NATIVE”, EDUCATING THE NATION         75\nthat childhood ought to be a time of self-learning, outside the \nrigid and restricting discipline of the schooling system set up \nby the British. Teachers had to be imaginative, understand \nthe child, and help the child develop her curiosity. According \nto Tagore, the existing schools killed the natural desire of the \nchild to be creative, her sense of wonder. \nTagore was of the view that creative learning could be \nencouraged only within a natural environment. So he chose to \nset up his school 100 kilometres away from Calcutta, in a rural \nsetting. He saw it as an abode of peace (santiniketan), where living \nin harmony with nature, children could cultivate their natural \ncreativity.\nIn many senses, Tagore and Mahatma Gandhi thought about \neducation in similar ways. There were, however, differences too. \nGandhiji was highly critical of Western civilisation and its worship \nof machines and technology. Tagore wanted to combine elements \nof modern Western civilisation with what he saw as the best within \nIndian tradition. He emphasised the need to teach science and \ntechnology at Santiniketan, along with art, music and dance. \nMany individuals and thinkers were thus thinking about the \nway a national educational system could be fashioned. Some \nwanted changes within the system set up by the British, and felt \nthat the system could be extended so as to include wider sections \nof people. Others urged that alternative systems be created so \nthat people were educated into a culture that was truly national. \nWho was to define what was truly national? The debate about \nwhat this “national education” ought to be continued till after \nindependence.\nFig. 12 – Children playing \nin a missionary school \nin Coimbatore, early \ntwentieth century \nBy the mid-nineteenth \ncentury, schools for girls \nwere being set up by \nChristian missionaries \nand Indian reform \norganisations.\nReprint 2024-25\n76\t\nOUR PASTS – III\nLet’s recall\n1.\tMatch the following:\nWilliam Jones\t\npromotion of English\n\t\neducation\nRabindranath\t\nrespect for ancient cultures \nTagore\nThomas Macaulay\t\ngurus\nMahatma Gandhi\t\nlearning in a natural \n\t\nenvironment\nPathshalas\t\ncritical of English education\n2.\tState whether true or false: \n(a)\t James Mill was a severe critic of the Orientalists.\n(b) \tThe 1854 Despatch on education was in favour \nEnglish being introduced as a medium of higher \neducation in India.\n(c)\t Mahatma Gandhi thought that promotion of \nliteracy was the most important aim of education.\n(d)\t Rabindranath Tagore felt that children ought to \nbe subjected to strict discipline.\nLet’s discuss\n3.\tWhy did William Jones feel the need to study Indian \nhistory, philosophy and law?\n4.

    "text": "Have you ever thought of how children lived about two \nhundred years ago? Nowadays most girls from middle-\nclass families go to school, and often study with boys. On \ngrowing up, many of them go to colleges and universities, \nand take up jobs after that. They have to be adults before \nthey are legally married, and according to law, they can \nmarry anyone they like, from any caste and community, \nand widows can remarry too. All women, like all men, \ncan vote and stand for \nelections. Of course, these \nrights are not actually \nenjoyed by all. Poor people \nhave little or no access to \neducation, and in many \nfamilies, women cannot \nchoose their husbands. \nTwo hundred years ago \nthings were very different. \nMost children were married \noff at an early age. Both \nHindu and Muslim men \ncould marry more than \none wife. In some parts of \nthe country, widows were \npraised if they chose death \nby burning themselves on \nthe funeral pyre of their husbands. Women who died in this \nmanner, whether willingly or otherwise, were called “sati”, \nmeaning virtuous women. Women’s rights to property were \nalso restricted. Besides, most women had virtually no access \nto education. In many parts of the country people believed \nthat if a woman was educated, she would become a widow.  \nWomen, Caste and \nReform\n7\nFig. 1 – Sati, painted by \nBalthazar Solvyn, 1813\nThis was one of the many \npictures of sati painted by the \nEuropean artists who came \nto India. The practice of sati \nwas seen as evidence of the \nbarbarism of the East.\nReprint 2024-25\nWOMEN, CASTE AND REFORM         79\nDifferences between men and women were not the \nonly ones in society. In most regions, people were divided \nalong lines of caste. Brahmans and Kshatriyas considered \nthemselves as “upper castes”. Others, such as traders \nand moneylenders (often referred to as Vaishyas) were \nplaced after them. Then came peasants, and artisans \nsuch as weavers and potters (referred to as Shudras). \nAt the lowest rung were those who laboured to keep \ncities and villages clean or worked at jobs that upper \ncastes considered “polluting”, that is, it could lead to \nthe loss of caste status. The upper castes also treated \nmany of these groups at the bottom as “untouchable”. \nThey were not allowed to enter temples, draw water \nfrom the wells used by the upper castes, or bathe in \nponds where upper castes bathed. They were seen as \ninferior human beings.\nOver the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, many of \nthese norms and perceptions slowly changed. Let us see \nhow this happened. \nWorking Towards Change\nFrom the early nineteenth century, we find debates and \ndiscussions about social customs and practices taking on \na new character. One important reason for this was the \ndevelopment of new forms of communication. For the \nfirst time, books, newspapers, magazines, leaflets and \npamphlets were printed. These were far cheaper and far \nmore accessible than the manuscripts that you have read \nabout in Class VII. Therefore ordinary people could read \nthese, and many of them could also write and express their \nideas in their own languages. All kinds of issues – social, \npolitical, economic and religious – could now be debated \nand discussed by men (and sometimes by women as well) \nin the new cities. The discussions could reach out to a \nwider public, and could become linked to movements for \nsocial change. \nThese debates were often initiated by Indian reformers \nand reform groups. One such reformer was Raja \nRammohun Roy (1772–1833). He founded a reform \nassociation known as the Brahmo Sabha (later known \nas the Brahmo Samaj) in Calcutta. People such as \nRammohun Roy are described as reformers because \nthey felt that changes were necessary in society, and \nunjust practices needed to be done away with. They \nthought that the best way to ensure such changes was \nby persuading people to give up old practices and adopt \na new way of life.\nActivity\nCan you think of the \nways in which social \ncustoms and practices \nwere discussed in the \npre-printing age when \nbooks, newspapers and \npamphlets were not \nreadily available?\nReprint 2024-25\n80 \nOUR PASTS – III\nRammohun Roy was keen to spread the knowledge of \nWestern education in the country and bring about greater \nfreedom and equality for women. He wrote about the way \nwomen were forced to bear the burden of domestic work, \nconfined to the home and the kitchen, and not allowed to \nmove out and become educated.\nChanging the lives of widows \nRammohun Roy was particularly moved by the problems \nwidows faced in their lives. He began a campaign against \nthe practice of sati.\nRammohun Roy was well versed in Sanskrit, Persian \nand several other Indian and Europeon languages. He tried \nto show through his writings that the practice of widow \nburning had no sanction in ancient texts. By the early \nnineteenth century, as you have read in Chapter 6, many \nBritish officials had also begun to criticise Indian traditions \nand customs. They were therefore, more than willing to \nlisten to Rammohun who was reputed to be a learned man. \nIn 1829, sati was banned. \nThe strategy adopted by Rammohun was used by \nlater reformers as well. Whenever they wished to \nchallenge a practice that seemed harmful, they tried \nto find a verse or sentence in the ancient sacred texts \nthat supported their point of view. They then suggested \nthat the practice as it existed at present was against \nearly tradition.\nFig. 2 – Raja Rammohun Roy, \npainted by Rembrandt Peale, 1833\nFig. 3 – Hook swinging \nfestival\nIn this popular festival, \ndevotees underwent a \npeculiar form of suffering \nas part of ritual worship. \nWith hooks pierced \nthrough their skin they \nswung themselves on \na wheel. In the early \nnineteenth century, when \nEuropean officials began \ncriticising Indian customs \nand rituals as barbaric, \nthis was one of the rituals \nthat came under attack. \nReprint 2024-25\nWOMEN, CASTE AND REFORM         81\n “We first tie them down to the pile” \nRammohun Roy published many pamphlets to spread his \nideas. Some of these were written as a dialogue between the \nadvocate and critic of a traditional practice. Here is one such \ndialogue on sati: \nADVOCATE OF SATI:\nWomen are by nature of inferior understanding, \nwithout resolution, unworthy of trust … Many of them, \non the death of their husbands, become desirous of \naccompanying them; but to remove every chance of \ntheir trying to escape from the blazing fire, in burning \nthem we first tie them down to the pile. \nOPPONENT OF SATI: \nWhen did you ever afford them a fair opportunity \nof exhibiting their natural capacity? How then can \nyou accuse them of want of understanding? If, after \ninstruction in knowledge and wisdom, a person cannot \ncomprehend or retain what has been taught him, we \nmay consider him as deficient; but if you do not educate \nwomen how can you see them as inferior.  \nFig. 4 – Swami Dayanand \nSaraswati\nDayanand founded the Arya Samaj \nin 1875, an organisation that \nattempted to reform Hinduism. \nFor instance, one of the most famous reformers, \nIshwarchandra Vidyasagar, used the ancient texts to \nsuggest that widows could remarry. His suggestion was \nadopted by British officials, and a law was passed in 1856 \npermitting widow remarriage. Those who were against \nthe remarriage of widows opposed Vidyasagar, and even \nboycotted him. \nBy the second half of the nineteenth century, the \nmovement in favour of widow remarriage spread to other \nparts of the country. In the Telugu-speaking areas of \nthe Madras Presidency, Veerasalingam Pantulu formed \nan association for widow remarriage. Around the same \ntime, young intellectuals and reformers in Bombay \npledged themselves to working for the same cause. In \nthe north, Swami Dayanand Saraswati, who founded the \nreform association called Arya Samaj, also supported \nwidow remarriage. \nYet, the number of widows who actually remarried \nremained low. Those who married were not easily accepted \nin society and conservative groups continued to oppose \nthe new law.  \nSource 1\nActivity\nThis argument was \ntaking place more \nthan 175 years ago. \nWrite down the \ndifferent arguments \nyou may have heard \naround you on the \nworth of women. In \nwhat ways have  the \nviews changed?\nReprint 2024-25\n82\t\nOUR PASTS – III\nGirls begin going to school\nMany of the reformers felt that education for girls was \nnecessary in order to improve the condition of women. \nVidyasagar in Calcutta and many other reformers in \nBombay set up schools for girls. When the first schools \nwere opened in the mid-nineteenth century, many \npeople were afraid of them. They feared that schools \nwould take girls away from home, prevent them from \ndoing their domestic duties. Moreover, girls had to travel \nthrough public places in order to reach school. Many \npeople felt that this would have a corrupting influence \non them. They felt that girls should stay away from \npublic spaces. Therefore, throughout the nineteenth \ncentury, most educated women were taught at home by \nliberal fathers or husbands. Sometimes women taught \nthemselves. Do you remember what you read about \nRashsundari Debi in your book Social and Political Life \nlast year? She was one of those who secretly learned \nto read and write in the flickering light of candles \nat night.\nIn the latter part of the century, schools for girls were \nestablished by the Arya Samaj in Punjab, and  Jyotirao \nPhule in Maharashtra.\nIn aristocratic Muslim households in North India, \nwomen learnt to read the Koran in Arabic. They were taught \nby women who came home to teach. Some reformers such \nas Mumtaz Ali reinterpreted verses from the Koran to argue \nfor women’s education. The first Urdu novels began to be \nwritten from the late nineteenth century. Amongst other \nthings, these were meant to encourage women to read \nabout religion and domestic management in a language \nthey could understand. \nWomen write about \nwomen\nFrom the early twentieth \ncentury, Muslim women \nlike the Begums of Bhopal \nplayed a notable role in \npromoting education among \nwomen. They founded a \nprimary school for girls at \nAligarh. Another remarkable \nwoman, Begum Rokeya \nSakhawat Hossain started \nschools for Muslim girls in \nPatna and Calcutta. She \nFig. 5\nIshwarchandra Vidyasagar\nFig. 6 – Students of Hindu Mahila \nVidyalaya, 1875\nWhen girls’ schools were first set \nup in the nineteenth century, it \nwas generally believed that the \ncurriculum for girls ought to be \nless taxing than that for boys. \nThe Hindu Mahila Vidyalaya \nwas  one of the first institutions \nto provide girls with the kind of \nlearning that was usual for boys \nat the time.\nReprint 2024-25\nwomen, caste and reform         83\nwas a fearless critic of conservative ideas, arguing that \nreligious leaders of every faith accorded an inferior \nplace to women. \nBy the 1880s, Indian women began to enter universities. \nSome of them trained to be doctors, some became \nteachers. Many women began to write and publish their \ncritical views on the place of women in society. Tarabai \nShinde, a woman educated at home at Poona, published \na book, Stripurushtulna, (A Comparison between Women \nand Men), criticising the social differences between men \nand women (Men Dominant Society).\nPandita Ramabai, a great \nscholar of Sanskrit, felt that  \nHinduism was oppressive towards \nwomen, and wrote a book about \nthe miserable lives of upper-caste \nHindu women. She founded a \nwidows’ home at Poona to provide \nshelter to widows who had been \ntreated badly by their husbands’ \nrelatives. Here women were \ntrained so that they could support \nthemselves economically. \nNeedless to say, all this more than \nalarmed the orthodox. For instance, \nmany Hindu nationalists felt that \nHindu women were adopting Western ways and that this \nwould corrupt Hindu culture and erode family values. \nOrthodox Muslims were also worried about the impact of  \nthese changes. \nAs you can see, by the end of the nineteenth century, \nwomen themselves were actively working for reform. \nThey wrote books, edited magazines, founded schools \nand training centres, and set up women’s associations. \nFrom the early twentieth century, they formed political \npressure groups to push through laws for female \nsuffrage (the right to vote) and better health care and \neducation for women. Some of them joined various \nkinds of nationalist and socialist movements from  \nthe 1920s.\nIn the twentieth century, leaders such as Jawaharlal \nNehru and Subhas Chandra Bose lent their support to \ndemands for greater equality and freedom for women. \nNationalist leaders promised that there would be full \nsuffrage for all men and women after Independence. \nHowever, till then they asked women to concentrate on \nthe anti-British struggles. \nOnce a woman’s \nhusband has died... \nFig. 7\nPandita Ramabai\nSource 2\nIn her book, \nStripurushtulna, \nTarabai Shinde wrote: \nIsn’t a woman’s life as \ndear to her as yours is \nto you? It’s as if women \nare meant to be made \nof something different \nfrom men altogether, \nmade from dust  from \nearth or rock or rusted \niron whereas you and \nyour lives are made \nfrom the purest gold. \n… You’re asking \nme what I mean. I \nmean once a woman’s \nhusband has died, … \nwhat’s in store for her? \nThe barber comes to \nshave all the curls and \nhair off her head, just \nto cool your eyes. … \nShe is shut out from \ngoing to weddings, \nreceptions and other \nauspicious occasions \nthat married women \ngo to. And why all these \nrestrictions? Because \nher husband has died. \nShe is unlucky: ill \nfate is written on her \nforehead. Her face is \nnot to be seen, it’s a \nbad omen.\nTarabai Shinde, Stripurushtulna\nReprint 2024-25\n84\t\nOUR PASTS – III\nLaw against child marriage  \nWith the growth of women’s organisations \nand writings on these issues, the \nmomentum for reform gained strength. \nPeople challenged another established \ncustom –  that of child marriage. There \nwere a number of Indian legislators in the \nCentral Legislative Assembly who fought \nto make a law preventing child marriage. \nIn 1929, the Child Marriage Restraint Act \nwas passed without the kind of bitter \ndebates and struggles that earlier laws \nhad seen. According to the Act, no man \nbelow the age of 18 and woman below \nthe age of 16 could marry. Subsequently \nthese limits were raised to 21 for men and \n18 for women.\nCaste and Social Reform\nSome of the social reformers we have been discussing \nalso criticised caste inequalities. Rammohun Roy \ntranslated an old Buddhist text that was critical of \ncaste. The Prarthana Samaj adhered to the tradition of \nBhakti that believed in spiritual equality of all castes. \nIn Bombay, the Paramhans Mandali was founded in \n1840 to work for the abolition of caste. Many of these \nreformers and members of reform associations were \npeople of upper castes. Often, in secret meetings, these \nreformers would violate caste taboos on food and touch, \nin an effort to get rid of the hold of caste prejudice in \ntheir lives. \nThere were also others who questioned the injustices \nof the caste social order. During the course of the \nnineteenth century, Christian missionaries began \nsetting up schools for tribal groups and “lower”-caste \nchildren. These children were thus equipped with some \nresources to make their way into a changing world.\nAt the same time, the poor began leaving their villages \nto look for jobs that were opening up in the cities. There \nwas work in the factories that were coming up, and jobs \nin municipalities. Think of the new demands of labour \nFig. 8 – Bride at the age of eight\nThis is a picture of a child bride at the beginning of the \ntwentieth century.

Drains had to \nbe dug, roads laid, buildings \nconstructed, and cities \ncleaned. This required coolies, \ndiggers, carriers, bricklayers, \nsewage cleaners, sweepers, \npalanquin bearers, rickshaw \npullers. Where did this labour \ncome from? The poor from \nthe villages and small towns, \nmany of them from low \ncastes, began moving to the \ncities where there was a new \ndemand for labour. Some also \nwent to work in plantations \nin Assam, Mauritius, Trinidad and Indonesia. Work in \nthe new locations was often very hard. But the poor, \nthe people from low castes, saw this as an opportunity \nto get away from the oppressive hold that upper-caste \nlandowners exercised over their lives and the daily \nhumiliation they suffered. \nWho could produce shoes?\nLeatherworkers have been traditionally held in \ncontempt since they work with dead animals \nwhich are seen as dirty and polluting. During \nthe First World War, however, there was a \nhuge demand for shoes for the armies. Caste \nprejudice against leather work meant that only \nthe traditional leather workers and shoemakers \nwere ready to supply army shoes. So they could \nask for high prices and gain impressive profits. \nThere were other jobs too. The army, for instance, \noffered opportunities. A number of Mahar people, who \nwere regarded as untouchable, found jobs in the Mahar \nRegiment. The father of B.R. Ambedkar, the leader of the \nDalit movement, taught at an army school.\nFig. 9 – A coolie ship, nineteenth \ncentury\nThis coolie ship – named John \nAllen – carried many Indian \nlabourers to Mauritius where \nthey did a variety of forms of hard \nlabour.

They were experts at \ncleaning hides, tanning them for use, and sewing \nsandals.\nReprint 2024-25\n86 \nOUR PASTS – III\nDemands for equality and justice\nGradually, by the second half of the nineteenth century, \npeople from within the Non-Brahman castes began \norganising movements against caste discrimination, and \ndemanded social equality and justice.\nThe Satnami movement in Central India was founded \nby Ghasidas who worked among the leatherworkers and \norganised a movement to improve their social status. In \neastern Bengal, Haridas Thakur’s Matua sect worked \namong Chandala cultivators. Haridas questioned \nBrahmanical texts that supported the caste system. \nIn what is present-day Kerala, a guru from Ezhava \ncaste, Shri Narayana Guru, proclaimed the ideals of \nunity for his people. He argued against treating people \nunequally on the basis of caste differences. According \nto him, all humankind belonged to the same caste. One \nof his famous statements was: \n“oru jati, oru matam, oru daivam \nmanushyanu” (one caste, one \nreligion, one god for humankind).\nAll these sects were founded \nby leaders who came from Non-\nBrahman castes and worked \namongst them.

Born in 1827, he studied in schools set up \nby Christian missionaries. On growing up, he developed \nhis own ideas about the injustices of caste society. He \nset out to attack the Brahmans’ claim that they were \nsuperior to others, since they were Aryans. Phule argued \nthat the Aryans were foreigners, who came from outside \nthe subcontinent, and defeated and subjugated the true \nchildren of the country – those who had lived here from \nbefore the coming of the Aryans.  As the Aryans established \ntheir dominance, they began looking at the defeated \npopulation as inferior, as low-caste people. According to \nPhule, the “upper” castes had no right to their land and \npower: in reality, the land belonged to indigenous people, \nthe so-called low castes. \nPhule claimed that before Aryan rule, there existed \na golden age when warrior-peasants tilled the land and \nruled the Maratha countryside in just and fair ways. \nHe proposed that Shudras (labouring castes) and Ati \nShudras (untouchables) should unite to challenge caste \ndiscrimination. The Satyashodhak Samaj, an association \nPhule founded, propagated caste equality.\nFig. 13 –  Jyotirao Phule\nIn 1873, Phule wrote a book named Gulamgiri, \nmeaning slavery. Some ten years before this, the \nAmerican Civil War had been fought, leading to the end \nof slavery in America. Phule dedicated his book to all \n “Me here and you over there” \nPhule was also critical of the anti-colonial nationalism that was \npreached by upper-caste leaders. He wrote:\nThe Brahmans have hidden away the sword of their religion \nwhich has cut the throat of the peoples’ prosperity and now \ngo about posing as great patriots of their country. They … \ngive this advice to ... our Shudra, Muslim and Parsi youth \nthat unless we put away all quarrelling amongst ourselves \nabout the divisions between high and low in our country \nand come together, our ... country will never make any \nprogress ...

He was concerned about the plight of \n“upper”-caste women, the miseries of the labourer, and \nthe humiliation of the “low” castes. This movement for \ncaste reform was continued in the twentieth century \nby other great dalit leaders like Dr B.R. Ambedkar \nin western India and E.V. Ramaswamy Naicker in \nthe south. \nWho could enter temples? \nAmbedkar was born into a Mahar family. As a child \nhe experienced what caste prejudice meant in \neveryday life. In school he was forced to sit \noutside the classroom on the ground, and \nwas not allowed to drink water from taps that \nupper-caste children used. After finishing \nschool, he got a fellowship to go to the US for \nhigher studies. On his return to India in 1919, he \nwrote extensively about “upper”-caste  power \nin contemporary society. \nIn 1927, Ambedkar started a temple entry \nmovement, in which his Mahar caste followers \nparticipated. Brahman priests were outraged \nwhen the Dalits used water from the \ntemple tank. \nAmbedkar led three such movements \nfor temple entry between 1927 and \n1935. His aim was to make everyone \nsee the power of caste prejudices \nwithin society. \nReprint 2024-25\nWOMEN, CASTE AND REFORM         89\nThe Non-Brahman movement\nIn the early twentieth century, the non-Brahman \nmovement started. The initiative came from those \nnon-Brahman castes that had acquired access to \neducation, wealth and influence. They argued that \nBrahmans were heirs of Aryan invaders from the north \nwho had conquered southern lands from the original \ninhabitants of the region – the indigenous Dravidian \nraces. They also challenged Brahmanical claims \nto power. \nE.V. Ramaswamy Naicker, or Periyar, as he \nwas called, came from a middle-class family. \nInterestingly, he had been an ascetic in his early \nlife and had studied Sanskrit scriptures carefully. \nLater, he became a member of the Congress, only \nto leave it in disgust when he found that at a feast \norganised by nationalists, seating arrangements \nfollowed caste distinctions – that is, the lower castes \nwere made to sit at a distance from the upper castes. \nConvinced that untouchables had to fight for their \ndignity, Periyar founded the Self Respect Movement. \nHe argued that untouchables were the true upholders \nof an original Tamil and Dravidian culture which \nhad been subjugated by Brahmans. He felt that \nall religious authorities saw social divisions and \ninequality as God-given. Untouchables had to free \nthemselves, therefore, from all religions in order to \nachieve social equality. \nPeriyar was an outspoken critic of Hindu scriptures, \nespecially the Codes of Manu, the ancient lawgiver, and \nthe Bhagavad Gita and the Ramayana. He said that \nthese texts had been used to establish the authority \nof Brahmans over lower castes and the domination of \nmen over women.\nThese assertions did not go unchallenged. The \nforceful speeches, writings and movements of lower-\ncaste leaders did lead to rethinking and some self- \ncriticism among upper-caste nationalist leaders. \nBut orthodox Hindu society also reacted by founding \nSanatan Dharma Sabhas and the Bharat Dharma \nMahamandal in the north, and associations like \nthe Brahman Sabha in Bengal. The object of these \nassociations was to uphold caste distinctions as a \ncornerstone of Hinduism, and show how this was \nsanctified by scriptures. Debates and struggles over \ncaste continued beyond the colonial period and are \nstill going on in our own times.\nPeriyar on women\nPeriyar wrote:\nOnly with the arrival \nof words such as \nThara Mukurtham our \nwomen had become \npuppets in the hands \nof their husbands … \nwe ended up with such \nfathers who advise \ntheir daughters ... that \nthey had been gifted \naway  to their husbands \nand they belong to \ntheir husband’s place. \nThis is the … result of \nour association with \nSanskrit.\n  Periyar, cited in Periyar \nChintahnaikal\nSource 5\nFig. 15 –  E.V.

It critically drew upon the ideals of \nreligions – especially of Hinduism and Christianity – looking at their negative \nand positive dimensions.\nDerozio and Young Bengal \nHenry Louis Vivian Derozio, a teacher at Hindu College, Calcutta, in the \n1820s, promoted radical ideas and encouraged his pupils to question all \nauthority. Referred to as the Young Bengal Movement, his students attacked \ntradition  and custom, demanded education for women and campaigned \nfor the freedom of thought and expression.\nThe Ramakrishna Mission and Swami Vivekananda\nNamed after Ramakrishna Paramhansa, Swami Vivekananda’s guru, the \nRamakrishna Mission stressed the ideal of salvation through social service \nand selfless action.\nSwami Vivekananda (1863-1902), whose original name was Narendra \nNath Dutta, combined the simple teachings of Sri Ramakrishna with his \nwell founded modern outlook and spread them all over the world.  After \nhearing him in the World Parliament of Religions at Chicago in 1893, the \nNew York Herald reported, “We feel how foolish it is to send missionaries \nto this learned nation”. Indeed, Swami Vivekananda was the first Indian \nin modern times, who re-established the spiritual pre-eminence of the \nVedanta philosophy on a global scale.  But his mission was not simply to \ntalk of religion.  He was extremely pained at the poverty and the misery \nof his country men.  He firmly believed that any reform could become \nsuccessful only by uplifting the condition of the masses. Therefore, his clarion call to the people \nof India was to rise above the narrow confines of their ‘religion of the kitchen’ and come together \nin the service of the nation. By sending out this call, he made a signal contribution to the nascent \nnationalism of India. His sense of nationalism was, however, not narrow in its conception.  He \nwas convinced that many of the problems facing the mankind could only be overcome if the \nnations of the world come together on an equal footing. Therefore, his exhortation to the youth \nwas to unite on the basis of a common spiritual heritage. In this exhortation, he became truly \n‘the symbol of a new spirit and a source of strength for the future’.\nThe Prarthana Samaj\nEstablished in 1867 at Bombay, the Prarthana Samaj sought to remove caste restrictions, \nabolish child marriage, encourage the education of women, and end the ban on widow \nremarriage. Its religious meetings drew upon Hindu, Buddhist and Christian texts.\nThe Veda Samaj\nEstablished in Madras (Chennai) in 1864, the Veda Samaj  was inspired by the Brahmo Samaj. \nIt worked to abolish caste distinctions and promote widow remarriage and women’s education. \nIts members believed in one God.

The answer that gradually \nemerged was: India was the people of India – all the \npeople irrespective of class, colour, caste, creed, \nlanguage, or gender. And the country, its resources and \nsystems, were meant for all of them. With this answer \ncame the awareness that the British were exercising \ncontrol over the resources of India and the lives of its \npeople, and until this control was ended, India could \nnot be for Indians.\nThis consciousness began to be clearly stated by the \npolitical associations formed after 1850, especially those \nthat came into being in the 1870s and 1880s. Most of \nthese were led by English-educated professionals such \nas lawyers. The more important ones were the Poona \nSarvajanik Sabha, the Indian Association, the Madras \nMahajan Sabha, the Bombay Presidency Association, and \nof course the Indian National Congress.\nNote the name, “Poona Sarvajanik Sabha”. The \nliteral meaning of “sarvajanik” is “of or for all the people” \n(sarva = all + janik = of the people). Though many of these \nassociations functioned in specific parts of the country, \ntheir goals were stated as the goals of all the people of \nIndia, not those of any one region, community or class. \nThey worked with the idea that the people should be \nsovereign – a modern consciousness and a key feature of \nnationalism. In other words, they believed that the Indian \npeople should be empowered to take decisions regarding \ntheir affairs.  \nThe dissatisfaction with British rule intensified in the \n1870s and 1880s. The Arms Act was passed in 1878, \ndisallowing Indians from possessing arms. In the same \nyear, the Vernacular Press Act was also enacted in an \neffort to silence those who were critical of the government. \nThe Act allowed the government to confiscate the \nassets of newspapers including their printing presses \nif the newspapers published anything that was found \n“objectionable”. In 1883, there was a furore over the \nattempt by the government to introduce the Ilbert Bill. The \nbill provided for the trial of British or European persons \nby Indians, and sought equality between British and \nIndian judges in the country. But when white opposition \nforced the government to withdraw the bill, Indians were \nenraged. The event highlighted the racial attitudes of the \nBritish in India.\nSovereign – The capacity \nto act independently \nwithout outside \ninterference \nReprint 2024-25\nTHE MAKING OF THE NATIONAL MOVEMENT: 1870s –1947         95\nThe need for an all-India organisation of educated \nIndians had been felt since 1880, but the Ilbert Bill \ncontroversy deepened this desire. The Indian National \nCongress was established when 72 delegates from all \nover the country met at Bombay in December 1885. The \nearly leadership – Dadabhai Naoroji, Pherozeshah Mehta, \nBadruddin Tyabji, W.C. Bonnerji, Surendranath Banerji, \nRomesh Chandra Dutt, S. Subramania Iyer, among \nothers – was largely from Bombay and Calcutta. Naoroji, \na businessman and publicist settled in London, and \nfor a time member of the British Parliament, guided the \nyounger nationalists. A retired British official, A.O. Hume, \nalso played a part in bringing Indians from the various \nregions together.  \nPublicist – Someone  \nwho publicises an idea by \ncirculating information, \nwriting reports, speaking \nat meetings\nA nation in the making\nIt has often been said that the Congress in the first twenty \nyears was “moderate” in its objectives and methods. During \nthis period, it demanded a greater voice for Indians in \nthe government and in administration.  It wanted the \nLegislative Councils to be made more representative, \ngiven more power, and introduced in provinces where \nnone existed.  It demanded that Indians be placed in high \npositions in the government. For this purpose, it called for \ncivil service examinations to be held in India as well, not \njust in London.  \nThe demand for Indianisation of the administration \nwas part of a movement against racism, since most \nimportant jobs at the time were monopolised by white \nActivity\nFrom the beginning the \nCongress sought to \nspeak for, and in the \nname of, all the Indian \npeople.

Since \nBritish officers were sending a major part of their large \nsalaries home, Indianisation, it was hoped, would also \nreduce the drain of wealth to England. Other demands \nincluded the separation of the judiciary from the \nexecutive, the repeal of the Arms Act and the freedom \nof speech and expression.  \nThe early Congress also raised a number of economic \nissues. It declared that British rule had led to poverty and \nfamines: increase in the land revenue had impoverished \npeasants and zamindars, and exports of grains to Europe \nhad created food shortages. The Congress demanded \nreduction of revenue, cut in military expenditure, and \nmore funds for irrigation. It passed many resolutions on \nthe salt tax, treatment of Indian labourers abroad, and \nthe sufferings of forest dwellers – caused by an interfering \nforest administration. All this shows that despite being \na body of the educated elite, the Congress did not \ntalk only on behalf of professional groups, zamindars \nor industrialists.  \nThe Moderate leaders wanted to develop public \nawareness about the unjust nature of British rule. \nThey published newspapers, wrote articles, and showed \nhow British rule was leading to the economic ruin \nof the country. They criticised British rule in their \nspeeches and sent representatives to different parts of \nthe country to mobilise public opinion. They felt that \nthe British had respect for the ideals of freedom and \njustice, and so they would accept the just demands of \nIndians. What was necessary, therefore, was to express \nthese demands, and make the government aware of the \nfeelings of Indians. \n“Freedom is our birthright”\nBy the 1890s, many Indians began to raise questions \nabout the political style of the Congress. In Bengal, \nMaharashtra and Punjab, leaders such as Bepin \nChandra Pal, Bal Gangadhar Tilak and Lala Lajpat \nRai were beginning to explore more radical objectives \nand methods. They criticised the Moderates for their \n“politics of prayers”, and emphasised the importance \nof self-reliance and constructive work. They argued \nthat people must rely on their own strength, not on the \n“good” intentions of the government; people must fight \nfor swaraj. Tilak raised the slogan, “Freedom is my \nbirthright and I shall have it!”\nIn pursuit of gold\nThis is what a Moderate \nleader, Dinshaw Wacha, \nwrote to Naoroji in 1887:\nP h e r o z e s h a h  i s \nnowadays too busy \nwith his personal work \n… They are already \nr i c h  e n o u g h  … \nM r .

At that time Bengal was the biggest \nprovince of British India and included \nBihar and parts of Orissa. The British \nargued for dividing Bengal for reasons of \nadministrative convenience. But what did \n“administrative convenience” mean? Whose \n“convenience” did it represent? Clearly, it \nwas closely tied to the interests of British \nofficials and businessmen. Even so, instead \nof removing the non-Bengali areas from the \nprovince, the government separated East \nBengal and merged it with Assam. Perhaps \nthe main British motives were to curtail the \ninfluence of Bengali politicians and to split the \nBengali people.  \nThe partition of Bengal infuriated people \nall over India. All sections of the Congress – \nthe Moderates and the Radicals, as they may \nbe called – opposed it. Large public meetings \nand demonstrations were organised and \nnovel methods of mass protest developed. The struggle \nthat unfolded came to be known as the Swadeshi \nmovement, strongest in Bengal but with echoes elsewhere \ntoo – in deltaic Andhra for instance, it was known as the \nVandemataram Movement.  \nFig. 3 – Balgangadhar Tilak\nNotice the name of the newspaper \nthat lies on the table. Kesari, \na Marathi newspaper edited \nby Tilak, became one of the \nstrongest critics of British rule.\nFig. 4 – Thousands joined the demonstrations during the Swadeshi movement\nReprint 2024-25\n98 \nOUR PASTS – III\nThe Swadeshi movement sought to oppose British \nrule and encourage the ideas of self-help, swadeshi \nenterprise, national education, and use of Indian \nlanguages. To fight for swaraj, the radicals advocated \nmass mobilisation and boycott of British institutions \nand goods. Some individuals also began to suggest \nthat “revolutionary violence” would be necessary to \noverthrow British rule. \nThe opening decades of the twentieth century were \nmarked by other developments as well. A group of Muslim \nlandlords and nawabs formed the All India Muslim \nLeague at Dacca in 1906. The League supported the \npartition of Bengal. It desired separate electorates for \nMuslims, a demand conceded by the government in \n1909. Some seats in the councils were now reserved for \nMuslims who would be elected by Muslim voters.  This \ntempted politicians to gather a following by distributing \nfavours to their own religious groups.\n Meanwhile, the Congress split in 1907. The Moderates \nwere opposed to the use of boycott. They felt that it \ninvolved the use of force. After the split, the Congress \ncame to be dominated by the Moderates with Tilak’s \nfollowers functioning from outside. The two groups \nreunited in December 1915. Next year, the Congress and \nthe Muslim League signed the historic Lucknow Pact and \ndecided to work together for representative government \nin the country.\nThe Growth of Mass Nationalism\nAfter 1919, the struggle against British rule gradually \nbecame a mass movement, involving peasants, tribals, \nstudents and women in large numbers and occasionally \nfactory workers as well. Certain business groups too began \nto actively support the Congress in the 1920s. Why was \nthis so? \nThe First World War altered the economic and political \nsituation in India. It led to a huge rise in the defence \nexpenditure of the Government of India. The government in \nturn increased taxes on individual incomes and business \nprofits. Increased military expenditure and the demands \nfor war supplies led to a sharp rise in prices which created \ngreat difficulties for the common people. On the other hand, \nbusiness groups reaped fabulous profits from the war. \nAs you have seen (Chapter 6), the war created a demand \nfor industrial goods (jute bags, cloth, rails) and caused \na decline of imports from other countries into India.

In Ahmedabad, \nhe led a successful millworkers’ strike in 1918.  \n Let us now focus in some detail on the movements \norganised between 1919 and 1922. \nThe Rowlatt Satyagraha \nIn 1919, Gandhiji gave a call for a satyagraha against the \nRowlatt Act that the British had just passed. The Act curbed \nfundamental rights such as the freedom of expression and \nstrengthened police powers. Mahatma Gandhi, Mohammad \nAli Jinnah and others felt that the government had no right to \nrestrict people’s basic freedoms. They criticised the Act as \n“devilish” and tyrannical. Gandhiji asked the Indian people \nto observe 6 April 1919 as a day of non-violent opposition \nto this Act, as a day of “humiliation and prayer” and \nhartal (strike). Satyagraha Sabhas were set up to launch  \nthe movement. \nThe Rowlatt Satyagraha turned out to be the first  \nall-India struggle against the British government \nalthough it was largely restricted to cities. In April 1919, \nthere were a number of demonstrations and hartals in \nthe country and the government used brutal measures \nto suppress them. The Jallianwala Bagh atrocities, \ninflicted by General Dyer in Amritsar on Baisakhi day \n(13 April), were a part of this repression. On learning \nabout the massacre, Rabindranath Tagore expressed \nthe pain and anger of the country by renouncing  \nhis knighthood.\nKnighthood – An honour \ngranted by the British \nCrown for exceptional \npersonal achievement or \npublic service\n \nFig. 7 – The walled compound in \nwhich General Dyer opened fire on \na gathering of people\nThe people are pointing to the \nbullet marks on the wall.\nActivity\nFind out about the \nJallianwala Bagh \nmassacre.

This was also the call of Mahatma \nGandhi who always saw India as a land of all the people \nwho lived in the country – Hindus, Muslims and those of \nother religions. He was keen that Hindus and Muslims \nsupport each other in any just cause. \nKhilafat agitation and the Non-Cooperation \nMovement  \nThe Khilafat issue was one such cause. In 1920, the  \nBritish imposed a harsh treaty on the Turkish Sultan or \nKhalifa. People were furious about this as they had been \nabout the Jallianwala massacre. Also, Indian Muslims \nwere keen that the Khalifa be allowed to retain control \nover Muslim sacred places in the erstwhile Ottoman \nEmpire. The leaders of the Khilafat agitation, Mohammad \nAli and Shaukat Ali, now wished to initiate a full-fledged \nNon-Cooperation Movement. Gandhiji supported their \ncall and urged the Congress to campaign against “Punjab \nwrongs” (Jallianwala massacre), the Khilafat wrong and \ndemand swaraj.\nThe Non-Cooperation Movement gained momentum \nthrough 1921–22. Thousands of students left government-\ncontrolled schools and colleges. Many lawyers such \nas Motilal Nehru, C.R. Das, C. Rajagopalachari and Asaf \nAli gave up their practices. British titles were surrendered \nand legislatures boycotted. People lit public bonfires of \nforeign cloth. The imports of foreign cloth fell drastically \nbetween 1920 and 1922. But all this was merely the tip of \nthe iceberg. Large parts of the country were on the brink \nof a formidable revolt.  \nPeople’s initiatives\nIn many cases, people resisted British rule non-violently. \nIn others, different classes and groups, interpreting \nGandhiji’s call in their own manner, protested in ways \nthat were not in accordance with his ideas. In either case, \npeople linked their movements to local grievances.  Let us \nlook at a few examples.  \nIn Kheda, Gujarat, Patidar peasants organised \nnon-violent campaigns against the high land revenue \ndemand of the British. In coastal Andhra and interior \nTamil Nadu, liquor shops were picketed. In the Guntur \ndistrict of Andhra Pradesh, tribals and poor peasants \nstaged a number of “forest satyagrahas”, sometimes \nsending their cattle into forests without paying grazing \nfee. They were protesting because the colonial state \nSource 3\nThe eternal law \nof suffering\nWhat did Mahatma \nGandhi mean by ahimsa \n(non-violence)? How \ncould ahimsa become the \nbasis of struggle? This is \nwhat Gandhiji said:\nNon-violence comes to \nus through doing good \ncontinually without the \nslightest expectation \nof return. … That \nis the indispensable \nlesson in non-violence \n… In South Africa \n… I succeeded in \nlearning the eternal \nlaw of suffering as \nthe only remedy for \nundoing wrong and \ninjustice. It means \npositively the law of \nnon-violence. You \nhave to be prepared \nto suffer cheerfully at \nthe hands of all and \nsundry and you will \nwish ill to no one, not \neven to those who may \nhave wronged you. \nMahatma Gandhi, \n12 March 1938\nPicket – People protesting \noutside a building or shop \nto prevent others from \nentering\nReprint 2024-25\n102 \nOUR PASTS – III\nhad restricted their use of forest resources in various \nways.  They believed that Gandhiji would get their taxes \nreduced and have the forest regulations abolished. In \nmany forest villages, peasants proclaimed swaraj and \nbelieved that “Gandhi Raj” was about to be established.\nIn Sind (now in Pakistan), Muslim traders and \npeasants were very enthusiastic about the Khilafat call. \nIn Bengal too, the Khilafat-Non-Cooperation alliance \ngave enormous communal unity and strength to the \nnational movement.  \nIn Punjab, the Akali agitation of the Sikhs sought to \nremove corrupt mahants – supported by the British – from \ntheir gurdwaras. This movement got closely identified with \nthe Non-Cooperation Movement. In Assam, tea garden \nlabourers, shouting “Gandhi Maharaj ki Jai”, demanded \na big increase in their wages. They left the British-\nowned plantations amidst declarations that they were \nfollowing Gandhiji’s wish. Interestingly, in the Assamese \nVaishnava songs of the period, the reference to Krishna \nwas substituted by “Gandhi Raja”.\nThe people’s Mahatma\nWe can see from the above that sometimes people \nthought of Gandhiji as a kind of messiah, as someone \nwho could help them overcome their misery and poverty. \nGandhiji wished to build class unity, not class conflict, \nyet peasants could imagine that he would help them \nin their fight against zamindars, and agricultural \nlabourers believed he would provide them land. At times, \nordinary people credited \nGandhiji with their \nown achievements. For \ninstance, at the end of \na powerful movement, \npeasants of Pratapgarh \nin the United Provinces \n(now Uttar Pradesh) \nmanaged to stop illegal \neviction of tenants; \nbut they felt it was \nGandhiji who had won \nthis demand for them. \nAt other times, using \nGandhiji’s name, tribals \nand peasants undertook \nactions that did not \nconform to Gandhian \nideals.\nFig. 8 –  A popular representation \nof Mahatma Gandhi\nIn popular images too Mahatma \nGandhi is often shown as a divine \nbeing occupying a place within \nthe pantheon of Indian gods. \nIn this image, he is driving \nKrishna’s chariot, guiding other \nnationalist leaders in the battle \nagainst the British.\nMahants – Religious \nfunctionaries of Sikh \ngurdwaras\nIllegal eviction – Forcible \nand unlawful throwing \nout of tenants from the \nland they rent \nReprint 2024-25\nTHE MAKING OF THE NATIONAL MOVEMENT: 1870s –1947         103\n“It was he who got bedakhli                         \nstopped in Pratapgarh”\nThe following is an extract from a CID report on the \nkisan movement in Allahabad district, January 1921:\nThe currency which Mr. Gandhi’s name has \nacquired even in the remotest villages is astonishing.  \nNo one seems to know quite who or what he is, but \nit is an accepted fact that what he says is so, and \nwhat he orders must be done.  He is a Mahatma or \nsadhu, a Pundit, a Brahmin who lives at Allahabad, \neven a deota … the real power of his name is to \nbe traced back to the idea that it was he who got \nbedakhli [illegal eviction] stopped in Pratapgarh \n… as a general rule, Gandhi is not thought of as \nbeing antagonistic to Government, but only to the \nzamindars … We are for Gandhiji and the Sarkar.\nThe happenings of 1922–1929\nMahatma Gandhi, as you know, was against violent \nmovements. He abruptly called off the Non-Cooperation \nMovement when in February 1922, a crowd of peasants \nset fire to a police station in Chauri Chaura. Twenty- two \npolicemen were killed on that day. The peasants were \nprovoked because the police had fired on their peaceful \ndemonstration. \nOnce the Non-Cooperation movement was over, \nGandhiji’s followers stressed that the Congress must \nundertake constructive work in the rural areas. Other \nleaders such as Chitta Ranjan Das and Motilal Nehru \nargued that the party should fight elections to the councils \nand enter them in order to influence government policies. \nThrough sincere social work in villages in the mid-1920s, \nthe Gandhians were able to extend their support base. This \nproved to be very useful in launching the Civil Disobedience \nmovement in 1930.\nTwo important developments of the mid-1920s were \nthe formation of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), \na Hindu organisation, and the Communist Party of India. \nThese parties have held very different ideas about the kind \nof country India should be.

For this purpose, they founded the Hindustan Socialist \nRepublican Association (HSRA) in 1928 at Ferozeshah Kotla in \nDelhi. On 17 December, 1928, Bhagat Singh, Azad and Rajguru \nassassinated Saunders, a police officer who was involved in the \nlathi-charge that had caused the death of Lala Lajpat Rai.\nOn 8 April, 1929, Bhagat Singh and B.K. Dutt threw a bomb in the \nCentral Legislative Assembly. The aim, as their leaflet explained, \nwas not to kill but “to make the deaf hear”, and to remind the \nforeign government of its callous exploitation.\nBhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru were executed on March 23, \n1931.  Bhagat Singh’s age at that time was only 23.\nFig. 10 – Demonstrators oppose the Simon Commission\nIn 1927, the British government in England decided to send a commission headed by Lord Simon \nto decide India’s political future. The Commission had no Indian representative. The decison created \nan outrage in India. All political groups decided to boycott the Commission. When the Commission           \narrived, it was met with demonstrations with banners saying “Simon Go Back”.\n The decade closed with the Congress resolving \nto fight for Purna Swaraj (complete independence) in \n1929 under the presidentship of Jawaharlal Nehru. \nConsequently, “Independence Day” was observed on 26 \nJanuary 1930 all over the country.\nFig. 11 – Bhagat Singh\n“It takes a loud  voice to make the deaf hear.\nInquilab Zindabad !”\nReprint 2024-25\nTHE MAKING OF THE NATIONAL MOVEMENT: 1870s –1947         105\nThe March to Dandi \nPurna Swaraj would never come on its \nown. It had to be fought for. In 1930, \nGandhiji declared that he would lead a \nmarch to break the salt law. According to \nthis law, the state had a monopoly on the \nmanufacture and sale of salt. Mahatma \nGandhi along with other nationalists \nreasoned that it was sinful to tax salt \nsince it is such an essential item of our \nfood. The Salt March related the general \ndesire of freedom to a specific grievance \nshared by everybody, and thus did not \ndivide the rich and the poor.  \nGandhiji and his followers marched   \nfor over 240 miles from Sabarmati to \nthe coastal town of Dandi where they \nbroke the government law by gathering \nnatural salt found on the seashore, \nand boiling sea water to produce salt.\nWomen in the freedom struggle: Ambabai from Karnataka\nFig. 12 – Mahatma Gandhi breaking the \nsalt law by picking up a lump of natural salt, \nDandi, 6 April 1930\nWomen from diverse backgrounds participated in the national movement. \nYoung and old, single and married, they came from rural and urban areas, from \nboth conservative and liberal homes. Their involvement was significant for the \nfreedom struggle, for the women’s movement, and for themselves personally.  \nBoth British officials and Indian nationalists felt that women’s participation gave \nthe national struggle an immense force. Participation in the freedom movement \nbrought women out of their homes. It gave them a place in the professions, \nin the governance of India, and it could pave the way for equality with men.\nWhat such participation meant for women is best recounted by them. Ambabai \nof Karnataka had been married at age twelve. Widowed at sixteen, she picketed \nforeign cloth and liquor shops in Udipi. She was arrested, served a sentence \nand was rearrested. Between prison terms she made speeches, taught spinning, \nand organised prabhat pheris.  Ambabai regarded these as the happiest days \nof her life because they gave it a new purpose and commitment.\n Women, however, had to fight  for their right to participate in the movement. \nDuring the Salt Satyagraha, for instance, even Mahatma Gandhi was initially \nopposed to women’s participation. Sarojini Naidu had to persuade him to allow \nwomen to join the movement.\nReprint 2024-25\n106 \nOUR PASTS – III\nPeasants, tribals and women participated \nin large numbers. A business federation \npublished a pamphlet on the salt issue. \nThe government tried to crush the \nmovement through brutal action against \npeaceful satyagrahis. Thousands were \nsent to jail. \nThe combined struggles of the Indian \npeople bore fruit when the Government of \nIndia Act of 1935 prescribed provincial \nautonomy and the government announced \nelections to the provincial legislatures in \n1937. The Congress formed governments \nin 7 out of 11 provinces.  \nIn September 1939, after two years of \nCongress rule in the provinces, the Second \nWorld War broke out.

Gandhiji and other leaders were jailed \nat once but the movement spread. It specially attracted \npeasants and the youth who gave up their studies to join it. \nCommunications and symbols of state authority \nwere attacked all over the country. In many areas \nthe people set up their own governments.  \nThe first response of the British was severe \nrepression. By the end of 1943, over 90,000 \npeople were arrested, and around 1,000 killed in \npolice firing. In many areas, orders were given to \nmachine-gun crowds from airplanes. The rebellion, \nhowever, ultimately brought the Raj to its knees.\nTowards Independence and Partition\nMeanwhile, in 1940 the Muslim League had \nmoved a resolution demanding “Independent \nStates” for Muslims in the north-western and \neastern areas of the country.

In developing this \nnotion, it may have been influenced by the history of tension \nbetween some Hindu and Muslim groups in the 1920s and \n1930s. More importantly, the provincial elections of 1937 \nseemed to have convinced the League that Muslims were a \nminority, and they would always have to play second fiddle \nin any democratic structure. It feared that Muslims may even \ngo unrepresented. The Congress’s rejection of the League’s \ndesire to form a joint Congress-League government in the \nUnited Provinces in 1937 also annoyed the League.\nThe Congress’s failure to mobilise the Muslim masses in \nthe 1930s allowed the League to widen its social support. It \nsought to enlarge its support in the early 1940s when most \nCongress leaders were in jail. At the end of the war in 1945, \nthe British opened negotiations between the Congress, the \nLeague and themselves for the independence of India. The talks \nfailed because the League saw itself as the sole spokesperson \nof India’s Muslims. The Congress could not accept this claim \nsince a large number of Muslims still supported it.\nElections to the provinces were again held in 1946.  The \nCongress did well in the “General” constituencies but \nthe League’s success in the seats reserved for Muslims was \nspectacular. It persisted with its demand for “Pakistan”. In March \n1946, the British cabinet sent a three-member mission to \nDelhi to examine this demand and to suggest a suitable \npolitical framework for a free India. This mission suggested \nthat India should remain united and constitute itself as a \nloose confederation with some autonomy for Muslim-majority \nareas. But it could not get the Congress and the Muslim \nLeague to agree to specific details of the proposal. Partition \nnow became more or less inevitable.  \nAfter the failure of the Cabinet \nMission, the Muslim League decided \non mass agitation for winning its \nPakistan demand. It announced 16 \nAugust 1946 as  “Direct  Action Day”. \nOn this day riots broke out in Calcutta, \nlasting several days and resulting in \nthe death of thousands of people. \nBy March 1947, violence spread to \ndifferent parts of northern India.\nMany hundred thousand people \nwere killed and numerous women \nhad to face untold brutalities during \nthe Partition.

    "text": "Nazism and the Rise of Hitler\n49\nIn the spring of 1945, a little eleven-year-old German boy called\nHelmuth was lying in bed when he overheard his parents discussing\nsomething in serious tones. His father, a prominent physician,\ndeliberated with his wife whether the time had come to kill the entire\nfamily, or if he should commit suicide alone. His father spoke about\nhis fear of revenge, saying, ‘Now the Allies will do to us what we did to\nthe crippled and Jews.’ The next day, he took Helmuth to the woods,\nwhere they spent their last happy time together, singing old children’s\nsongs. Later, Helmuth’s father shot himself in his office. Helmuth\nremembers that he saw his father’s bloody uniform being burnt in the\nfamily fireplace. So traumatised was he by what he had overheard and\nwhat had happened, that he reacted by refusing to eat at home for the\nfollowing nine years! He was afraid that his mother might poison him.\nAlthough Helmuth may not have realised all that it meant, his father\nhad been a Nazi and a supporter of Adolf Hitler. Many of you will\nknow something about the Nazis and Hitler. You probably know\nof Hitler’s determination to make Germany into a mighty power\nand his ambition of conquering all of Europe. You may have heard\nthat he killed Jews. But Nazism was not one or two isolated acts. It\nwas a system, a structure of ideas about the world and politics. Let\nus try and understand what Nazism was all about. Let us see why\nHelmuth’s father killed himself and what the basis of his fear was.\nIn May 1945, Germany surrendered to the Allies. Anticipating what\nwas coming, Hitler, his propaganda minister Goebbels and his entire\nfamily committed suicide collectively in his Berlin bunker in April.\nAt the end of the war, an International Military Tribunal at\nNuremberg was set up to prosecute Nazi war criminals for Crimes\nagainst Peace, for War Crimes and Crimes Against Humanity.\nGermany’s conduct during the war, especially those actions which\nNazism and the Rise\nNazism and the Rise\nNazism and the Rise\nNazism and the Rise\nNazism and the Rise\nof Hitler\nof Hitler\nof Hitler\nof Hitler\nof Hitler\nNazism and the Rise of Hitler\nFig.1 – Hitler (centre) and Goebbels (left)\nleaving after an official meeting, 1932.\nNew words\nAllies – The Allied Powers were initially led by the UK and France.\nIn 1941 they were joined by the USSR and USA.

What\nwere these acts?\nUnder the shadow of the Second World War, Germany had waged\na genocidal war, which resulted in the mass murder of selected\ngroups of innocent civilians of Europe. The number of people killed\nincluded 6 million Jews, 200,000 Gypsies, 1 million Polish civilians,\n70,000 Germans who were considered mentally and physically\ndisabled, besides innumerable political opponents. Nazis devised\nan unprecedented means of killing people, that is, by gassing them in\nvarious killing centres like Auschwitz. The Nuremberg Tribunal\nsentenced only eleven leading Nazis to death. Many others were\nimprisoned for life. The retribution did come, yet the punishment\nof the Nazis was far short of the brutality and extent of their crimes.\nThe Allies did not want to be as harsh on defeated Germany as\nthey had been after the First World War.\nEveryone came to feel that the rise of Nazi Germany could be\npartly traced back to the German experience at the end of  the\nFirst World War.\nWhat was this experinece?\nNew words\nGenocidal – Killing on large scale leading\nto destruction of large sections of people\nReprint 2025-26\nNazism and the Rise of Hitler\n51\nGermany, a powerful empire in the early years of the twentieth\ncentury,  fought the First World War (1914-1918) alongside the\nAustrian empire  and against the Allies (England, France and Russia.)\nAll joined the war enthusiastically hoping to gain from a quick\nvictory. Little did they realise that the war would stretch on,\neventually draining Europe of all its resources. Germany made initial\ngains by occupying France and Belgium. However the Allies,\nstrengthened by the US entry in 1917, won , defeating Germany and the\nCentral Powers in November 1918.\nThe defeat of Imperial Germany and the abdication of the emperor\ngave an opportunity to parliamentary parties to recast German polity.\nA National Assembly met at Weimar and established a democratic\nconstitution with a federal structure. Deputies were now elected to\nthe German Parliament or Reichstag, on the basis of equal and\nuniversal votes cast by all adults including women.\nThis republic, however, was not received well by its own people\nlargely because of the terms it was forced to accept after Germany’s\ndefeat at the end of the First  World War.

From a continent of creditors,\nEurope turned into one of debtors. Unfortunately, the infant Weimar\nRepublic was being made to pay for the sins of the old empire. The\nrepublic carried the burden of war guilt and national humiliation\nand was financially crippled by being forced to pay compensation.\nThose who supported the Weimar Republic, mainly Socialists, Catholics\nand Democrats, became easy targets of attack in the conservative\nnationalist circles. They were mockingly called the ‘November criminals’.\nThis mindset had a major impact on the political developments of the\nearly 1930s, as we will soon see.\nThe First World War left a deep imprint on European society and\npolity. Soldiers came to be placed above civilians. Politicians and\npublicists laid great stress on the need for men to be aggressive, strong\nand masculine. The media glorified trench life. The truth, however,\nwas that soldiers lived miserable lives in these trenches, trapped with\nrats feeding on corpses. They faced poisonous gas and enemy shelling,\nand witnessed their ranks reduce rapidly. Aggressive war propaganda\nand national honour occupied centre stage in the public sphere, while\npopular support grew for conservative dictatorships that had recently\ncome into being. Democracy was indeed a young and fragile idea,\nwhich could not survive the instabilities of interwar Europe.\n1.2 Political Radicalism and Economic Crises\nThe birth of the Weimar Republic coincided with the revolutionary\nuprising of the Spartacist League on the pattern of the Bolshevik\nRevolution in Russia. Soviets of workers and sailors were established\nVersailles with the Allies was a harsh and humiliating peace. Germany lost\nits overseas colonies, a tenth of its population, 13 per cent of its territories,\n75 per cent of its iron and 26 per cent of its coal to France, Poland,\nDenmark and Lithuania. The Allied Powers demilitarised Germany to\nweaken its power. The War Guilt Clause held Germany responsible for\nthe war and  damages the Allied countries suffered. Germany was forced\nto pay compensation amounting to £6 billion. The Allied armies also\noccupied the resource-rich Rhineland for much of the 1920s. Many\nGermans held the new Weimar Republic responsible for not only the\ndefeat in the war but the disgrace at Versailles.\nReprint 2025-26\nNazism and the Rise of Hitler\n53\nin many cities. The political atmosphere in Berlin was charged with\ndemands for Soviet-style governance. Those opposed to this – such\nas the socialists, Democrats and Catholics – met in Weimar to give\nshape to the democratic republic. The Weimar Republic crushed the\nuprising with the help of a war veterans organisation called Free\nCorps. The anguished Spartacists later founded the Communist Party of\nGermany. Communists and Socialists henceforth became irreconcilable\nenemies and could not make common cause against Hitler. Both\nrevolutionaries and militant nationalists craved for radical solutions.\nPolitical radicalisation was only heightened by the economic crisis\nof 1923. Germany had fought the war largely on loans and had to\npay war reparations in gold. This depleted gold reserves at a time\nresources were scarce. In 1923 Germany refused to pay, and the\nFrench occupied its leading industrial area, Ruhr, to claim their coal.\nGermany retaliated with passive resistance and printed paper currency\nrecklessly. With too much  printed money in circulation, the value\nof the German mark fell. In April the US dollar was equal to 24,000\nmarks, in July 353,000 marks, in August 4,621,000 marks  and  at\nFig.3 – This is a rally organised by the radical group known as the Spartacist League.\nIn the winter of 1918-1919 the streets of Berlin were taken over by the people. Political demonstrations became common.\nFig.4 – Baskets and carts being loaded at a\nbank in Berlin with paper currency for wage\npayment, 1923. The German mark had so\nlittle value that vast amounts had to be used\neven for small payments.\nNew words\nDeplete – Reduce, empty out\nReparation – Make up for a wrong done\nReprint 2025-26\nIndia and the Contemporary World\n54\n98,860,000 marks by December, the figure had run into trillions. As\nthe value of the mark collapsed, prices of goods soared. The image of\nGermans carrying cartloads of currency notes to buy a loaf of bread\nwas widely publicised evoking worldwide sympathy. This crisis came\nto be known as hyperinflation, a situation when prices rise\nphenomenally high.\nEventually, the Americans intervened and bailed Germany out of\nthe crisis by introducing the Dawes Plan, which reworked the terms\nof reparation to ease the financial burden on Germans.\n1.3 The Years of Depression\nThe years between 1924 and 1928 saw some stability. Yet this was\nbuilt on sand. German investments and industrial recovery were\ntotally dependent on short-term loans, largely from the USA. This\nsupport was withdrawn when the Wall Street Exchange crashed in\n1929. Fearing a fall in prices, people made frantic efforts to sell their\nshares. On one single day, 24 October, 13 million shares were sold.\nThis was the start of the Great Economic Depression. Over the next\nthree years, between 1929 and 1932, the national income of the USA\nfell by half. Factories shut down, exports fell, farmers were badly hit\nand speculators withdrew their money from the market. The effects\nof this recession in the US economy were felt worldwide.\nThe German economy was the worst hit by the economic crisis. By\n1932, industrial production was reduced to 40 per cent of the 1929\nlevel. Workers lost their jobs or were paid reduced wages. The number\nof unemployed touched an unprecedented 6 million. On the streets\nof Germany you could see men with placards around their necks\nsaying, ‘Willing to do any work’. Unemployed youths played cards\nor simply sat at street corners, or desperately queued up at the local\nemployment exchange. As jobs disappeared, the youth took to\ncriminal activities and total despair became  commonplace.\nThe economic crisis created deep anxieties and fears in people. The\nmiddle classes, especially salaried employees and pensioners, saw\ntheir savings diminish when the currency lost its value. Small\nbusinessmen, the self-employed and retailers suffered as their\nFig.5 – Homeless men queuing up for a\nnight’s shelter, 1923.\nFig.6  – Sleeping on the line.

These sections of society were filled with the\nfear of proletarianisation, an anxiety of being reduced to the ranks\nof the working class, or worse still, the unemployed. Only organised\nworkers could manage to keep their heads above water, but\nunemployment weakened their bargaining power. Big business was\nin crisis. The large mass of peasantry was affected by a sharp fall in\nagricultural prices and women, unable to fill their children’s\nstomachs, were filled with a sense of deep despair.\nPolitically too the Weimar Republic was fragile. The Weimar\nconstitution had some inherent defects, which made it unstable\nand vulnerable to dictatorship. One was proportional\nrepresentation. This made achieving a majority by any one party a\nnear impossible task, leading to a rule by coalitions. Another defect\nwas Article 48, which gave the President the powers to impose\nemergency, suspend civil rights and rule by decree. Within its short\nlife, the Weimar Republic saw twenty different cabinets lasting on\nan average 239 days, and a liberal use of Article 48. Yet the crisis\ncould not be managed. People lost confidence in the democratic\nparliamentary system, which seemed to offer no solutions.\nNew words\nProletarianisation – To become impoverished to the level of\nworking classes.\nReprint 2025-26\nIndia and the Contemporary World\n56\nThis crisis in the economy, polity and society formed the background\nto Hitler’s rise to power. Born in 1889 in Austria, Hitler spent his\nyouth in poverty. When the First World War broke out, he enrolled\nfor the army, acted as a messenger in the front, became a corporal, and\nearned medals for bravery. The German defeat horrified him and the\nVersailles Treaty made him furious. In 1919, he joined a small group\ncalled the German Workers’ Party. He subsequently took over the\norganisation and renamed it the National Socialist German Workers’\nParty. This party came to be known as the Nazi Party.\nIn 1923, Hitler planned to seize control of Bavaria, march to Berlin\nand capture power. He failed, was arrested, tried for treason, and\nlater released. The Nazis could not effectively mobilise popular\nsupport till the early 1930s. It was during the Great Depression that\nNazism became a mass movement. As we have seen, after 1929, banks\ncollapsed and businesses shut down, workers lost their jobs and the\nmiddle classes were threatened with destitution. In such a situation\nNazi propaganda stirred hopes of a better future. In 1928, the Nazi\nParty got no more than 2. 6 per cent votes in the Reichstag – the\nGerman parliament. By 1932, it had become the largest party with\n37 per cent votes.\n2  Hitler’s Rise to Power\nFig.7 – Hitler being greeted at the Party Congress in Nuremberg in 1938.\nNew words\nPropaganda – Specific type of message\ndirectly aimed at influencing the opinion\nof people (through the use of posters, films,\nspeeches, etc.)\nReprint 2025-26\nNazism and the Rise of Hitler\n57\nHitler was a powerful speaker. His passion and his words moved\npeople. He promised to build a strong nation, undo the injustice of\nthe Versailles Treaty and restore the dignity of the German people.\nHe promised employment for those looking for work, and a secure\nfuture for the youth. He promised to weed out all foreign influences\nand resist all foreign ‘conspiracies’ against Germany.\nHitler devised a new style of politics. He understood the significance\nof rituals and spectacle in mass mobilisation. Nazis held massive rallies\nand public meetings to demonstrate the support for Hitler and instil\na sense of unity among the people. The Red banners with the\nSwastika, the Nazi salute, and the ritualised rounds of applause after\nthe speeches were all part of this spectacle of power.\nFig.9 — Hitler addressing SA and SS columns.\nNotice the sweeping and straight columns of\npeople. Such photographs were intended to\nshow the grandeur and power of the Nazi\nmovement\nFig.8 – Nuremberg Rally, 1936.\nRallies like this were held every year. An\nimportant aspect of these was the\ndemonstration of Nazi power as various\norganisations paraded past Hitler, swore\nloyalty and listened to his speeches.\nReprint 2025-26\nIndia and the Contemporary World\n58\nNazi propaganda skilfully projected Hitler as a messiah, a saviour, as\nsomeone who had arrived to deliver people from their distress. It is\nan image that captured the imagination of a people whose sense of\ndignity and pride had been shattered, and who were living in a time\nof acute economic and political crises.\n2.1 The Destruction of Democracy\nOn 30 January 1933, President Hindenburg offered the\nChancellorship, the highest position in the cabinet of ministers, to\nHitler. By now the Nazis had  managed to rally the conservatives to\ntheir cause. Having acquired power, Hitler set out to dismantle the\nstructures of democratic rule. A mysterious fire that broke out in\nthe German Parliament building in February facilitated his move.\nThe Fire Decree of 28 February 1933 indefinitely suspended civic\nrights like freedom of speech, press and assembly that had been\nguaranteed by the Weimar constitution. Then he turned on his arch-\nenemies, the Communists, most of whom were hurriedly packed off\nto the newly established concentration camps. The repression of\nthe Communists was severe. Out of the surviving 6,808 arrest files\nof Duesseldorf, a small city of half a million population, 1,440 were\nthose of Communists alone. They were, however, only one among\nthe 52 types of victims persecuted by the Nazis across the country.\nOn 3 March 1933, the famous Enabling Act was passed. This Act\nestablished dictatorship in Germany. It gave Hitler all powers to\nsideline Parliament and rule by decree. All political parties and trade\nunions were banned except for the Nazi Party and its affiliates. The\nstate established complete control over the economy, media, army\nand judiciary.\nSpecial surveillance and security forces were created to control and\norder society in ways that the Nazis wanted.  Apart from the already\nexisting regular police in green uniform and the SA or the Storm\nTroopers, these included the Gestapo (secret state police), the SS (the\nprotection squads), criminal police and the Security Service (SD). It\nwas the extra-constitutional powers of these newly organised forces\nthat gave the Nazi state its reputation as the most dreaded criminal\nstate. People could now be detained in Gestapo torture chambers,\nrounded up and sent to concentration camps, deported at will or\narrested without any legal procedures. The police forces acquired\npowers to rule with impunity.\nNew words\nConcentration camp – A camp where people\nwere isolated and detained without due\nprocess of law. Typically, it was surrounded\nby electrified barbed wire fences.\nReprint 2025-26\nNazism and the Rise of Hitler\n59\n2.2 Reconstruction\nHitler assigned the responsibility of economic recovery to the\neconomist Hjalmar Schacht who aimed at full production and full\nemployment through a state-funded work-creation programme. This\nproject produced the famous German superhighways and the\npeople’s car, the Volkswagen.\nIn foreign policy also Hitler acquired quick successes. He pulled\nout of the League of Nations in 1933, reoccupied the Rhineland in\n1936, and integrated Austria and Germany in 1938 under the slogan,\nOne people, One empire, and One leader. He then went on to wrest German-\nspeaking Sudentenland from Czechoslovakia, and gobbled up the\nentire country. In all of this he had the unspoken support of\nEngland, which had considered the Versailles verdict too harsh.\nThese quick successes at home and abroad seemed to reverse the\ndestiny of the country.\nHitler did not stop here. Schacht had advised Hitler against investing\nhugely in rearmament as the state still ran on deficit financing.\nCautious people, however, had no place in Nazi Germany. Schacht\nhad to leave. Hitler chose war as the way out of the approaching\nFig.10 – The poster announces: ‘Your\nvolkswagen’.\nSuch posters suggested that owning a car was\nno longer just a dream for an ordinary worker.\nFig.11 – Expansion of Nazi power: Europe 1942.\nReprint 2025-26\nIndia and the Contemporary World\n60\neconomic crisis. Resources were to be accumulated through\nexpansion of territory.  In September 1939, Germany invaded\nPoland. This started a war with France and England. In September\n1940, a Tripartite Pact was signed between Germany, Italy and\nJapan, strengthening Hitler’s claim to international power. Puppet\nregimes, supportive of Nazi Germany, were installed in a large\npart of Europe. By the end of 1940, Hitler was at the pinnacle of\nhis power.\nHitler now moved to achieve his long-term aim of conquering\nEastern Europe. He wanted to ensure food supplies and living space\nfor Germans.  He attacked the Soviet Union in June 1941. In this\nhistoric blunder Hitler exposed the German western front to British\naerial bombing and the eastern front to the powerful Soviet armies.\nThe Soviet Red Army inflicted a crushing and humiliating defeat\non Germany at Stalingrad.  After this the Soviet Red Army\nhounded out the retreating German soldiers until they reached the\nheart of Berlin, establishing Soviet hegemony over the entire Eastern\nEurope for half a century thereafter.\nMeanwhile, the USA had resisted involvement in the war. It was\nunwilling to once again face all the economic problems that the\nFirst World War had caused. But it could not stay out of the war\nfor long. Japan was expanding its power in the east. It had occupied\nFrench Indo-China and was planning attacks on US naval bases in\nthe Pacific. When Japan extended its support to Hitler and bombed\nthe US base at Pearl Harbor, the US entered the Second World\nWar. The war ended in May 1945 with Hitler’s defeat and the US\ndropping of the atom bomb on Hiroshima in Japan.\nFrom this brief account of what happened in the Second World\nWar, we now return to Helmuth and his father’s story, a story of\nNazi criminality during the war.\nFig.12 – Newspapers in India track the\ndevelopments in Germany.\nReprint 2025-26\nNazism and the Rise of Hitler\n61\nActivity\nThe crimes that Nazis committed were linked to a system of belief\nand a set of practices.\nNazi ideology was synonymous with Hitler’s worldview. According\nto this there was no equality between people, but only a racial\nhierarchy. In this view blond, blue-eyed, Nordic German Aryans\nwere at the top, while Jews were located at the lowest rung. They\ncame to be regarded as an anti-race, the arch-enemies of the Aryans.\nAll other coloured people were placed in between depending upon\ntheir external features. Hitler’s racism borrowed from thinkers like\nCharles Darwin and Herbert Spencer. Darwin was a natural scientist\nwho tried to explain the creation of plants and animals through the\nconcept of evolution and natural selection. Herbert Spencer later\nadded the idea of survival of the fittest. According to this idea, only\nthose species survived on earth that could adapt themselves to\nchanging climatic conditions. We should bear in mind that Darwin\nnever advocated human intervention in what he thought was a purely\nnatural process of selection. However, his ideas were used by racist\nthinkers and politicians to justify imperial rule over conquered\npeoples. The Nazi argument was simple: the strongest race would\nsurvive and the weak ones would perish. The Aryan race was the\nfinest. It had to retain its purity, become stronger and dominate the\nworld.\nThe other aspect of Hitler’s ideology related to the geopolitical\nconcept of Lebensraum, or living space. He believed that new territories\nhad to be acquired for settlement. This would enhance the area of\nthe mother country, while enabling the settlers on new lands to retain\nan intimate link with the place of their origin. It would also enhance\nthe material resources and power of the German nation.\nHitler intended to extend German boundaries by moving eastwards,\nto concentrate all Germans geographically in one place. Poland became\nthe laboratory for this experimentation.\n3.1 Establishment of the Racial State\nOnce in power, the Nazis quickly began to implement their dream\nof creating an exclusive racial community of pure Germans by\nphysically eliminating all those who were seen as  ‘undesirable’ in the\n3  The Nazi Worldview\nSource A\n‘For this earth is not allotted to anyone\nnor is it presented to anyone as a gift.

Nazis wanted only a society of ‘pure and healthy\nNordic Aryans’. They alone were considered ‘desirable’. Only they\nwere seen as worthy of prospering and multiplying against all others\nwho were classed as ‘undesirable’. This meant that even those Germans\nwho were seen as impure or abnormal had no right to exist. Under\nthe Euthanasia Programme, Helmuth’s father along with other Nazi\nofficials had condemned to death many Germans who were considered\nmentally or physically unfit.\nJews were not the only community classified as ‘undesirable’. There\nwere others. Many Gypsies and blacks living in Nazi Germany were\nconsidered as racial ‘inferiors’ who threatened the biological purity\nof the ‘superior Aryan’ race. They were widely persecuted. Even\nRussians and Poles were considered subhuman, and hence undeserving\nof any humanity. When Germany occupied Poland and parts of\nRussia, captured civilians were forced to work as slave labour. Many\nof them died simply through hard work and starvation.\nJews remained the worst sufferers in Nazi Germany. Nazi hatred  of\nJews had a precursor in the traditional Christian hostility towards\nJews. They had been stereotyped as killers of Christ and\nusurers.Until medieval times  Jews were barred from owning land.\nThey survived mainly through trade and moneylending. They lived\nin separately marked areas called ghettos. They were often persecuted\nthrough periodic organised violence, and expulsion from the land.\nHowever, Hitler’s hatred of Jews was based on pseudoscientific\ntheories of race, which held that conversion was no solution to\n‘the Jewish problem’. It could be solved only through their\ntotal elimination.\nFrom 1933 to 1938 the Nazis terrorised, pauperised and segregated\nthe Jews, compelling them to leave the country. The next phase,\n1939-1945, aimed at concentrating them in certain areas and eventually\nkilling them in gas chambers in Poland.\n3.2 The Racial Utopia\nUnder the shadow of war, the Nazis proceeded to realise their\nmurderous, racial ideal. Genocide and war became two sides of the\nsame coin. Occupied Poland was divided up. Much of north-western\nPoland was annexed to Germany. Poles were forced to leave their\nhomes and properties behind to be occupied by ethnic Germans\nbrought in from occupied Europe.

These\nbecame sites of extreme misery and poverty. Jews had to surrender all their wealth before they entered a ghetto.

He felt\nthat a strong Nazi society could be established only by teaching children\nNazi ideology. This required a control over the child both inside and\noutside school.\nWhat happened in schools under Nazism? All schools were ‘cleansed’\nand ‘purified’. This meant that teachers who were Jews or seen as\n‘politically unreliable’ were dismissed. Children were first segregated:\nGermans and Jews could not sit together or play together.\nSubsequently, ‘undesirable children’ – Jews,  the physically handicapped,\nGypsies – were thrown out of schools. And finally in the 1940s, they\nwere taken to the gas chambers.\n‘Good German’ children were subjected to a process of Nazi schooling,\na prolonged period of ideological training. School textbooks were\nrewritten. Racial science was introduced to justify Nazi ideas of race.\nStereotypes about Jews were popularised even through maths classes.\nChildren were taught to be loyal and submissive, hate Jews, and worship\nHitler. Even the function of sports was to nurture a spirit of violence\nand aggression among children. Hitler believed that boxing could make\nchildren iron hearted, strong and masculine.\nYouth organisations were made responsible for educating German\nyouth in the ‘the spirit of National Socialism’. Ten-year-olds had to\nenter Jungvolk.  At 14, all boys had to join the Nazi youth organisation\n– Hitler Youth – where they learnt to worship war, glorify aggression\nand violence, condemn democracy, and hate Jews, communists, Gypsies\nand all those categorised as ‘undesirable’. After a period of rigorous\nideological and physical training they joined the Labour Service, usually\nat the age of 18. Then they had to serve in the armed forces and enter\none of the Nazi organisations.\nThe Youth League of the Nazis was founded in 1922. Four years later\nit was renamed Hitler Youth. To unify the youth movement under\nNazi control, all other youth organisations were systematically dissolved\nand finally banned.\n4  Youth in Nazi Germany\nIf you were a student sitting in one of these\nclasses, how would you have felt towards\nJews?\nHave you ever thought of the stereotypes of\nother communities that people around you\nbelieve in?

We consider it\nnatural that these two worlds remain\ndistinct…What the man gives in courage\non the battlefield, the woman gives in\neternal self-sacrifice, in eternal pain and\nsuffering.

They had to be the bearers of the Aryan\nculture and race.\nIn 1933 Hitler said: ‘In my state the mother is the most important\ncitizen.’ But in Nazi Germany all mothers were not treated equally.\nWomen who bore racially undesirable children were punished\nand those who produced racially desirable children were awarded.\nThey were given favoured treatment in hospitals and were also\nentitled to concessions in shops and on theatre tickets and railway\nfares. To encourage women to produce many children, Honour\nCrosses were awarded. A bronze cross was given for four children,\nsilver for six and gold for eight or more.\nAll ‘Aryan’ women who deviated from the prescribed code of\nconduct were publicly condemned, and severely punished. Those\nwho maintained contact with Jews, Poles and Russians were\nparaded through the town with shaved heads, blackened faces and\nplacards hanging around their necks announcing ‘I have sullied\nthe honour of the nation’. Many received jail sentences and lost\ncivic honour as well as their husbands and families for this\n‘criminal offence’.\n4.2. The Art of Propaganda\nThe Nazi regime used language and media with care, and often to\ngreat effect. The terms they coined to describe their various\npractices are not only deceptive. They are chilling. Nazis never\nused the words ‘kill’ or ‘murder’ in their official communications.\nMass killings were termed special treatment, final solution (for the Jews),\neuthanasia (for the disabled), selection and disinfections. ‘Evacuation’\nmeant deporting people to gas chambers. Do you know what the\ngas chambers were called? They were labelled ‘disinfection-areas’,\nand looked like bathrooms equipped with fake showerheads.\nMedia was carefully used to win support for the regime and\npopularise its worldview. Nazi ideas were spread through visual\nimages, films, radio, posters, catchy slogans and leaflets. In posters,\ngroups identified as the ‘enemies’ of Germans were stereotyped,\nmocked, abused and described as evil. Socialists and liberals were\nrepresented as weak and degenerate. They were attacked as\nmalicious foreign agents. Propaganda films were made to create\nhatred for Jews. The most infamous film was The Eternal Jew.\nOrthodox Jews were stereotyped and marked.

They were\nreferred to as vermin, rats and pests. Their movements were compared\nto those of rodents.

They felt hatred and anger surge inside them when\nthey saw someone who looked like a Jew. They marked the houses\nof Jews and reported suspicious neighbours. They genuinely believed\nNazism would bring prosperity  and improve general well-being.\nBut not every German was a Nazi. Many organised active resistance\nto Nazism, braving police repression and death. The large majority\nof Germans, however, were passive onlookers and apathetic witnesses.\nThey were too scared to act, to differ, to protest. They preferred to\nlook  away. Pastor Niemoeller, a resistance fighter, observed an\nabsence of protest, an uncanny silence, amongst ordinary Germans\nin the face of brutal and organised crimes committed against people\nin the Nazi empire. He wrote movingly about this silence:\n‘First they came for the Communists,\nWell, I was not a Communist –\nSo I said nothing.\nThen they came for the Social Democrats,\nWell, I was not a Social Democrat\nSo I did nothing,\nThen they came for the trade unionists,\nBut I was not a trade unionist.\nAnd then they came for the Jews,\nBut I was not a Jew – so I did little.\nThen when they came for me,\nThere was no one left who could stand up for me.’\nWas the lack of concern for Nazi victims only\nbecause of the Terror? No, says Lawrence\nRees who interviewed people from diverse\nbackgrounds for his recent documentary,\n‘The Nazis: A Warning from History’.\nErna Kranz, an ordinary German teenager in\nthe1930s and a grandmother now,  said to\nRees:\n‘1930s offered a glimmer of hope, not just for\nthe unemployed but for everybody for we all\nfelt downtrodden. From my own experience I\ncould say salaries increased and Germany\nseemed to have regained its sense of\npurpose. I could only say for myself, I thought\nit was a good time.

How do you\nview her opinion?\nReprint 2025-26\nIndia and the Contemporary World\n72\nWhat Jews felt in Nazi Germany is a different story altogether.\nCharlotte Beradt secretly recorded people’s dreams in her diary and\nlater published them in a highly disconcerting book called the Third\nReich of Dreams. She describes how Jews themselves began believing in\nthe Nazi stereotypes about them. They dreamt of their hooked noses,\nblack hair and eyes, Jewish looks and body movements. The\nstereotypical images publicised in the Nazi press haunted the Jews.\nThey troubled them even in their dreams. Jews died many deaths\neven before they reached the gas chamber.\n5.1 Knowledge about the Holocaust\nInformation about Nazi practices had trickled out of Germany\nduring the last years of the regime. But it was only after the war\nended and Germany was defeated that the world came to realise the\nhorrors of what had happened. While the Germans were preoccupied\nwith their own plight as a defeated nation emerging out of the rubble,\nthe Jews wanted the world to remember the atrocities and sufferings\nthey had endured during the Nazi killing operations – also called the\nHolocaust. At its height, a ghetto inhabitant had said to another that\nhe wanted to outlive the war just for half an hour. Presumably he\nmeant that he wanted to be able to tell the world about what had\nhappened in Nazi Germany. This indomitable spirit to bear witness\nand to preserve the documents can be seen in many ghetto and camp\ninhabitants who wrote diaries, kept notebooks, and created archives.\nOn the other hand when the war seemed lost, the Nazi leadership\ndistributed petrol to its functionaries to destroy all incriminating\nevidence available in offices.\nYet the history and the memory of the Holocaust live on in memoirs,\nfiction, documentaries, poetry, memorials and museums in many\nparts of the world today. These are a tribute to those who resisted it,\nan embarrassing reminder to those who collaborated, and a warning\nto those who watched in silence.\nFig.31 – Inhabitants of the Warsaw ghetto\ncollected documents and placed them in three\nmilk cans along with other containers.

As you\nhave read, before the eighteenth century society was broadly divided\ninto estates and orders and it was the aristocracy and church which\ncontrolled economic and social power. Suddenly, after the revolution,\nit seemed possible to change this. In many parts of the world including\nEurope and Asia, new ideas about individual rights and who\ncontrolled social power began to be discussed. In India, Raja\nRammohan Roy and Derozio talked of the significance of the French\nRevolution, and many others debated the ideas of post-revolutionary\nEurope. The developments in the colonies, in turn, reshaped these\nideas of societal change.\nNot everyone in Europe, however, wanted a complete transformation\nof society. Responses varied from those who accepted that some\nchange was necessary but wished for a gradual shift, to those who\nwanted to restructure society radically. Some were ‘conservatives’,\nothers were ‘liberals’ or ‘radicals’. What did these terms really mean\nin the context of the time? What separated these strands of politics\nand what linked them together? We must remember that these terms\ndo not mean the same thing in all contexts or at all times.\nWe will look briefly at some of the important political traditions of\nthe nineteenth century, and see how they influenced change. Then\nwe will focus on one historical event in which there was an attempt\nat a radical transformation of society. Through the revolution in\nRussia, socialism became one of the most significant and powerful\nideas to shape society in the twentieth century.\n1.1 Liberals, Radicals and Conservatives\nOne of the groups which looked to change society were the liberals.\nLiberals wanted a nation which tolerated all religions. We should\nremember that at this time European states usually discriminated in\nSocialism in Europe and the Russian Revolution\nChapter II\nReprint 2025-26\nIndia and the Contemporary World\n26\nfavour of one religion or another (Britain favoured the Church of\nEngland, Austria and Spain favoured the Catholic Church). Liberals\nalso opposed the uncontrolled power of dynastic rulers. They wanted\nto safeguard the rights of individuals against governments. They\nargued for a representative, elected parliamentary government, subject\nto laws interpreted by a well-trained judiciary that was independent\nof rulers and officials. However, they were not ‘democrats’. They\ndid not believe in universal adult franchise, that is, the right of every\ncitizen to vote. They felt men of property mainly should have the\nvote. They also did not want the vote for women.\nIn contrast, radicals wanted a nation in which government was based\non the majority of a country’s population. Many supported women’s\nsuffragette movements. Unlike liberals, they opposed the privileges\nof great landowners and wealthy factory owners. They were not\nagainst the existence of private property but disliked concentration\nof property in the hands of a few.\nConservatives were opposed to radicals and liberals. After the French\nRevolution, however, even conservatives had opened their minds to\nthe need for change. Earlier, in the eighteenth century, conservatives\nhad been generally opposed to the idea of change. By the nineteenth\ncentury, they accepted that some change was inevitable but believed\nthat the past had to be respected and change had to be brought about\nthrough a slow process.\nSuch differing ideas about societal change clashed during the social\nand political turmoil that followed the French Revolution. The\nvarious attempts at revolution and national transformation in the\nnineteenth century helped define both the limits and potential of\nthese political tendencies.\n1.2 Industrial Society and Social Change\nThese political trends were signs of a new time. It was a time of\nprofound social and economic changes. It was a time when new cities\ncame up and new industrialised regions developed,  railways expanded\nand the Industrial Revolution occurred.\nIndustrialisation brought men, women and children to factories.  Work\nhours were often long and wages were poor. Unemployment was\ncommon, particularly during times of low demand for industrial goods.\nHousing and sanitation were problems since towns were growing\nrapidly. Liberals and radicals searched for solutions to these issues.\nNew words\nSuffragette movement – A movement to\ngive women the right to vote.\nReprint 2025-26\nSocialism in Europe and the Russian Revolution\n27\nAlmost all industries were the property of individuals.  Liberals and\nradicals themselves were often property owners and employers.\nHaving made their wealth through trade or industrial ventures, they\nfelt that such effort should be encouraged – that its benefits would\nbe achieved if the workforce in the economy was healthy and citizens\nwere educated. Opposed to the privileges the old aristocracy had by\nbirth, they firmly believed in the value of individual effort, labour\nand enterprise. If freedom of individuals was ensured, if the poor\ncould labour, and those with capital could operate without restraint,\nthey believed that societies would develop. Many working men and\nwomen who wanted changes in the world rallied around liberal and\nradical groups and parties in the early nineteenth century.\nSome nationalists, liberals and radicals wanted revolutions to put an\nend to the kind of governments established in Europe in 1815. In\nFrance, Italy, Germany and Russia, they became revolutionaries and\nworked to overthrow existing monarchs. Nationalists talked of\nrevolutions that would create ‘nations’ where all citizens would have\nFig.1 – The London poor in the mid-nineteenth century as seen by a\ncontemporary.\nFrom: Henry Mayhew, London Labour and the London Poor, 1861.\nReprint 2025-26\nIndia and the Contemporary World\n28\nActivity\nequal rights. After 1815, Giuseppe Mazzini, an Italian nationalist, conspired\nwith others to achieve this in Italy. Nationalists elsewhere – including India\n– read his writings.\n1.3 The Coming of Socialism to Europe\nPerhaps one of the most far-reaching visions of how society should be\nstructured was socialism. By the mid - nineteenth century in Europe, socialism\nwas a well-known body of ideas that attracted widespread attention.\nSocialists were against private property, and saw it as the root of all social ills\nof the time. Why? Individuals owned the property that gave employment\nbut the propertied were concerned only with  personal gain and not with\nthe welfare of those who made the property productive. So if society as a\nwhole rather than single individuals controlled property, more attention\nwould be paid to collective social interests. Socialists wanted this change and\ncampaigned for it.\nHow could a society without property operate? What would be the basis of\nsocialist society?\nSocialists had different visions of the future. Some believed in the idea of\ncooperatives. Robert Owen (1771-1858), a leading English manufacturer,\nsought to build a cooperative community called New Harmony in Indiana\n(USA). Other socialists felt that cooperatives could not be built on a wide\nscale only through individual initiative: they demanded that governments\nencourage cooperatives. In France, for instance, Louis Blanc (1813-1882)\nwanted the government to encourage cooperatives and replace capitalist\nenterprises. These cooperatives were to be associations of people who\nproduced goods together and divided the profits according to the work\ndone by members.\nKarl Marx (1818-1883) and Friedrich Engels (1820-1895) added other ideas\nto this body of arguments. Marx argued that industrial society was ‘capitalist’.\nCapitalists owned the capital invested in factories, and the profit of capitalists\nwas produced by workers.  The conditions of workers could not improve\nas long as this profit was accumulated by private capitalists. Workers had to\noverthrow capitalism and the rule of private property. Marx believed that\nto free themselves from capitalist exploitation, workers had to construct a\nradically socialist society where all property was socially controlled. This\nwould be a communist society. He was convinced that workers would\ntriumph in their conflict with capitalists. A communist society was the natural\nsociety of the future.\nList two differences between the capitalist\nand socialist ideas of private property.\nReprint 2025-26\nSocialism in Europe and the Russian Revolution\n29\nActivity\n1.4 Support for Socialism\nBy the 1870s, socialist ideas spread through Europe. To coordinate\ntheir efforts, socialists formed an international body – namely, the\nSecond International.\nWorkers in England and Germany began forming associations to\nfight for better living and working conditions. They set up funds to\nhelp members in times of distress and demanded a reduction of working\nhours and the right to vote. In Germany, these associations worked closely\nwith the Social Democratic Party (SPD) and helped it win parliamentary\nseats. By 1905, socialists and trade unionists formed a Labour Party in\nBritain and a Socialist Party in France. However, till 1914, socialists never\nsucceeded in forming a government in Europe. Represented by strong\nfigures in parliamentary politics, their ideas did shape legislation, but\ngovernments continued to be run by conservatives, liberals and radicals.\nImagine that a meeting has been called in\nyour area to discuss the socialist idea of\ndoing away with private property and\nintroducing collective ownership. Write the\nspeech you would make at the meeting if you\nare:\nØ a poor labourer working in the fields\nØ a medium-level landowner\nØ a house owner\nFig.2 – This is a painting of the Paris Commune of 1871 (From Illustrated London News, 1871). It portrays a scene from the\npopular uprising in Paris between March and May 1871. This was a period when the town council (commune) of Paris was\ntaken over by a ‘peoples’ government’ consisting of workers, ordinary people, professionals, political activists and others.\nThe uprising emerged against a background of growing discontent against the policies of the French state. The ‘Paris\nCommune’ was ultimately crushed by government troops but it was celebrated by Socialists the world over as a prelude to a\nsocialist revolution.The Paris Commune  is also popularly remembered for two important legacies: one, for its association with\nthe workers’ red flag – that was the flag adopted by the communards ( revolutionaries) in Paris; two, for the ‘Marseillaise’,\noriginally written as a war song in 1792, it became a symbol of the Commune and of the struggle for liberty.\nReprint 2025-26\nIndia and the Contemporary World\n30\n2  The Russian Revolution\nIn one of the least industrialised of European states this situation was\nreversed. Socialists took over the government in Russia through the\nOctober Revolution of 1917. The fall of monarchy in February 1917\nand the events of October are normally called the Russian Revolution.\nHow did this come about? What were the social and political\nconditions in Russia when the revolution occurred? To answer these\nquestions, let us look at Russia a few years before the revolution.\n2.1 The Russian Empire in 1914\nIn 1914, Tsar Nicholas II ruled Russia and its empire. Besides the\nterritory around Moscow, the Russian empire included current-day\nFinland, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, parts of Poland, Ukraine and\nBelarus. It stretched to the Pacific and comprised today’s Central\nAsian states, as well as Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan. The majority\nreligion was Russian Orthodox Christianity – which had grown out\nof the Greek Orthodox Church – but the empire also  included\nCatholics, Protestants, Muslims and Buddhists.\nFig.3 – Tsar Nicholas II in the White\nHall of the Winter Palace,\nSt Petersburg, 1900.\nPainted by Earnest Lipgart (1847-1932)\nFig.4 – Europe in 1914.\nThe map shows the Russian empire and the European countries at war during the First\nWorld War.\nReprint 2025-26\nSocialism in Europe and the Russian Revolution\n31\n2.2 Economy and Society\nAt the beginning of the twentieth century, the vast majority of\nRussia’s people were agriculturists. About 85 per cent of the Russian\nempire’s population earned their living from agriculture. This\nproportion was higher than in most European countries. For instance,\nin France and Germany the proportion was between 40 per cent and\n50 per cent. In the empire, cultivators produced for the market as\nwell as for their own needs and Russia was a major exporter of grain.\nIndustry was found in pockets. Prominent industrial areas were\nSt Petersburg and Moscow. Craftsmen undertook much of the\nproduction, but large factories existed alongside craft workshops.\nMany factories were set up in the 1890s, when Russia’s railway\nnetwork was extended, and foreign investment in industry increased.\nCoal production doubled and iron and steel output quadrupled. By\nthe 1900s, in some areas factory workers and craftsmen were almost\nequal in number.\nMost industry was the private property of industrialists. Government\nsupervised large factories to ensure minimum wages and limited hours\nof work. But factory inspectors could not prevent rules being broken.\nIn craft units and small workshops, the working day was sometimes\n15 hours, compared with 10 or 12 hours in factories. Accommodation\nvaried from rooms to dormitories.\nWorkers were a divided social group. Some had strong links with\nthe villages from which they came. Others had settled in cities\npermanently. Workers were divided by skill. A metalworker of St.\nPetersburg recalled, ‘Metalworkers considered themselves aristocrats\namong other workers. Their occupations demanded more training\nand skill . . . ’ Women made up 31 per cent of the factory labour\nforce by 1914, but they were paid less than men (between half and\nthree-quarters of a man’s wage). Divisions among workers showed\nthemselves in dress and manners too. Some workers formed\nassociations to help members in times of unemployment or financial\nhardship but such associations were few.\nDespite divisions, workers did unite to strike work (stop work) when\nthey disagreed with employers about dismissals or work conditions.\nThese strikes took place  frequently in the textile industry during\n1896-1897, and in the metal industry during 1902.\nIn the countryside, peasants cultivated most of the land. But the\nnobility, the crown and the Orthodox Church owned large\nproperties. Like workers, peasants too were divided. They were also\nFig.5 – Unemployed peasants in pre-war\nSt Petersburg.\nMany survived by eating at charitable\nkitchens and living in poorhouses.\nFig.6 – Workers sleeping in bunkers in a\ndormitory in pre-revolutionary Russia.\nThey slept in shifts and could not keep their\nfamilies with them.\nReprint 2025-26\nIndia and the Contemporary World\n32\nSource A\ndeeply religious. But except in a few cases they had no respect for the\nnobility. Nobles got their power and position through their services\nto the Tsar, not through local popularity. This was unlike France\nwhere, during the French Revolution in Brittany, peasants respected\nnobles and fought for them. In Russia, peasants wanted the land of\nthe nobles to be given to them. Frequently, they refused to pay rent\nand even murdered landlords. In 1902, this occurred on a large scale\nin south Russia. And in 1905,  such incidents took place all\nover Russia.\nRussian peasants were different from other European peasants in\nanother way. They pooled their land together periodically and their\ncommune (mir) divided it according to the needs of individual families.\n2.3 Socialism in Russia\nAll political parties were illegal in Russia before 1914. The Russian\nSocial Democratic Workers Party was founded in 1898 by socialists\nwho respected Marx’s ideas. However, because of government\npolicing, it had to operate as an illegal organisation. It set up a\nnewspaper, mobilised workers and organised strikes.\nSome Russian socialists felt that the Russian peasant custom of dividing\nland periodically made them natural socialists. So peasants, not\nworkers, would be the main force of the revolution, and Russia could\nbecome socialist more quickly than other countries. Socialists were\nactive in the countryside through the late nineteenth century.  They\nformed the Socialist Revolutionary Party in 1900. This party struggled\nfor peasants’ rights and demanded that land belonging to nobles be\ntransferred to peasants. Social Democrats disagreed with Socialist\nRevolutionaries about peasants. Lenin felt that peasants were not\none united group. Some were poor and others rich, some worked as\nlabourers while others were capitalists who employed workers. Given\nthis ‘differentiation’ within them, they could not all be part of a\nsocialist movement.\nThe party was divided over the strategy of organisation. Vladimir\nLenin (who led the Bolshevik group) thought that in a repressive\nsociety like Tsarist Russia the party should be disciplined and should\ncontrol the number and quality of its members.  Others (Mensheviks)\nthought that the party should be open to all (as in Germany).\n2.4 A Turbulent Time: The 1905 Revolution\nRussia was an autocracy.

Liberals in Russia campaigned to end this state of affairs.\nTogether with the Social Democrats and Socialist Revolutionaries,\nthey worked with peasants and workers during the revolution of\n1905 to demand a constitution. They were supported in the empire\nby nationalists (in Poland for instance) and in Muslim-dominated\nareas by jadidists who wanted modernised Islam to lead their societies.\nThe year 1904 was a particularly bad one for Russian workers. Prices\nof essential goods rose so quickly that real wages declined by 20 per\ncent. The membership of workers’ associations rose dramatically.\nWhen four members of the Assembly of Russian Workers, which\nhad been formed in 1904, were dismissed at the Putilov Iron Works,\nthere was a call for industrial action. Over the next few days over\n110,000 workers in St Petersburg went on strike demanding a\nreduction in the working day to eight hours, an increase in wages\nand improvement in working conditions.\nWhen the procession of workers led by Father Gapon reached the\nWinter Palace it was attacked by the police and the Cossacks. Over\n100 workers were killed and about 300 wounded. The incident,\nknown as Bloody Sunday, started a series of events that became known\nas the 1905 Revolution. Strikes took place all over the country and\nuniversities closed down when student bodies staged walkouts,\ncomplaining about the lack of civil liberties. Lawyers, doctors,\nengineers and other middle-class workers established the Union of\nUnions and demanded a constituent assembly.\nDuring the 1905 Revolution, the Tsar allowed the creation of an\nelected consultative Parliament or Duma. For a brief while during\nthe revolution, there existed a large number of trade unions and\nfactory committees made up of factory workers. After 1905, most\ncommittees and unions worked unofficially, since they were declared\nillegal. Severe restrictions were placed on political activity. The Tsar\ndismissed the first Duma within 75 days and the re-elected second\nDuma within three months. He did not want any questioning of his\nauthority or any reduction in his power. He changed the voting\nlaws and packed the third Duma with conservative politicians. Liberals\nand revolutionaries were kept out.\n2.5 The First World War and the Russian Empire\nIn 1914, war broke out between two European alliances – Germany,\nAustria and Turkey (the Central powers) and France, Britain and\nRussia  (later Italy and Romania).

It was the\nlargest armed force in  the world. When this\narmy shifted its loyalty and began supporting\nthe revolutionaries, Tsarist power collapsed.\nand the war was fought outside Europe as well as\nin Europe. This was the First World War.\nIn Russia, the war was initially popular and people\nrallied around Tsar Nicholas II. As the war\ncontinued, though, the Tsar refused to consult the\nmain parties in the Duma. Support wore thin. Anti-\nGerman sentiments ran high,  as can be seen in the\nrenaming of St Petersburg – a German name – as\nPetrograd. The Tsarina Alexandra’s German\norigins and poor advisers, especially a monk called\nRasputin, made the autocracy unpopular.\nThe First World War on the ‘eastern front’ differed\nfrom that on the ‘western front’. In the west, armies\nfought from trenches stretched along eastern\nFrance. In the east, armies moved a good deal and\nfought battles leaving large casualties. Defeats were\nshocking and demoralising. Russia’s armies lost\nbadly in Germany and Austria  between 1914 and\n1916. There were over 7 million casualties by 1917.\nAs they retreated, the Russian army destroyed\ncrops and buildings to prevent the enemy from\nbeing able to live off the land. The destruction of\ncrops and buildings led to over 3 million refugees in Russia. The\nsituation discredited the government and the Tsar.  Soldiers did not\nwish to fight such a war.\nThe war also had a severe impact on industry. Russia’s own industries\nwere few in number and  the country was cut off from other suppliers\nof industrial goods by German control of the Baltic Sea. Industrial\nequipment disintegrated more rapidly in Russia than elsewhere in\nEurope. By 1916, railway lines began to break down. Able-bodied\nmen were called up to the war. As a result, there were labour shortages\nand small workshops producing essentials were shut down. Large\nsupplies of grain were sent to feed the army. For the people in the\ncities, bread and flour  became scarce. By the winter of 1916, riots at\nbread shops were common.\nReprint 2025-26\nSocialism in Europe and the Russian Revolution\n35\nIn the winter of 1917, conditions in the capital, Petrograd, were grim.\nThe layout of the city seemed to emphasise the divisions among its\npeople. The workers’ quarters and factories were located on the right\nbank of the River Neva. On the left bank were the fashionable areas,\nthe Winter Palace, and official buildings, including the palace where\nthe Duma met. In February 1917, food shortages were deeply felt in\nthe workers’ quarters. The winter was  very cold – there had been\nexceptional frost and heavy snow. Parliamentarians wishing to\npreserve elected government, were opposed to the Tsar’s  desire to dissolve\nthe Duma.\nOn 22 February, a lockout took place at a\nfactory on the right bank. The next day, workers\nin fifty factories called a strike in sympathy.\nIn many factories, women led the way to strikes.\nThis came to be called the International Women’s\nDay. Demonstrating workers crossed from the\nfactory quarters to the centre of the capital – the\nNevskii Prospekt. At this stage, no political party\nwas actively organising the movement. As the\nfashionable quarters and official buildings were\nsurrounded by workers, the government imposed\na curfew. Demonstrators dispersed by the evening,\nbut they came back on the 24th and 25th. The\ngovernment called out the cavalry and police to\nkeep an eye on them.\nOn Sunday, 25 February, the government\nsuspended the Duma.   Politicians spoke out against\nthe measure. Demonstrators returned in force to\nthe streets of the left bank on the 26th. On the\n27th, the Police Headquarters were ransacked. The\nstreets thronged with people raising slogans about\nbread, wages, better hours and democracy. The\ngovernment tried to control the situation and\ncalled out the cavalry once again. However, the\ncavalry refused to fire on the demonstrators. An\nofficer was shot at the barracks of a regiment and\nthree other regiments mutinied, voting to join the\nstriking workers.  By that evening, soldiers and\n3  The February Revolution in Petrograd\nFig.8 – The Petrograd Soviet meeting in the Duma, February 1917.\nReprint 2025-26\nIndia and the Contemporary World\n36\nBox 1\nActivity\nstriking workers had gathered to form a ‘soviet’ or ‘council’ in the\nsame building as the Duma met. This was the Petrograd Soviet.\nThe very next day, a delegation went to see the Tsar. Military\ncommanders advised him to abdicate. He followed their advice and\nabdicated on 2 March. Soviet leaders and Duma leaders formed a\nProvisional Government to run the country. Russia’s future would\nbe decided by a constituent assembly, elected on the basis of universal\nadult suffrage. Petrograd had led the February Revolution that\nbrought down the monarchy in February 1917.\nWomen in the February Revolution\n‘Women workers, often ... inspired their male co-workers … At the Lorenz telephone\nfactory, … Marfa Vasileva almost single handedly called a successful strike. Already that\nmorning, in celebration of Women’s Day, women workers had presented red bows to the\nmen … Then Marfa Vasileva, a milling machine operator stopped work and declared an\nimpromptu strike. The workers on the floor were ready to support her … The foreman\ninformed the management and sent her a loaf of bread.  She took the bread but refused to\ngo back to work. The administrator asked her again why she refused to work and she\nreplied, “I cannot be the only one who is satiated when others are hungry”.  Women\nworkers from another section of the factory gathered around Marfa in support and\ngradually all the other women ceased working. Soon the men downed their tools as well\nand the entire crowd rushed onto the street.’\nFrom: Choi Chatterji, Celebrating Women (2002).\n3.1 After February\nArmy officials, landowners and industrialists were influential in\nthe Provisional Government. But the liberals as well as socialists\namong them worked towards an elected government. Restrictions\non public meetings and associations were removed. ‘Soviets’, like\nthe Petrograd Soviet, were set up everywhere, though no common\nsystem of election was followed.\nIn April 1917, the Bolshevik leader Vladimir Lenin returned to\nRussia from his exile. He and the Bolsheviks had opposed the war\nsince 1914. Now he felt it was time for soviets to take over power.\nHe declared that the war be brought to a close, land be transferred\nto the peasants, and banks be nationalised. These three demands\nwere Lenin’s ‘April Theses’. He also argued that the Bolshevik Party\nrename itself the Communist Party to indicate its new radical aims.\nMost others in the Bolshevik Party were initially surprised by the\nApril Theses.

But the developments of the subsequent months changed\ntheir attitude.\nThrough the summer the workers’ movement spread. In industrial\nareas, factory committees were formed  which began questioning\nthe way industrialists ran their factories. Trade unions grew in\nnumber. Soldiers’ committees were formed in the army. In June,\nabout 500 Soviets sent representatives to an All Russian Congress\nof Soviets. As the Provisional Government saw its power reduce\nand Bolshevik influence grow, it decided to take stern measures\nagainst the spreading discontent. It resisted attempts by workers\nto run factories and began arresting leaders. Popular\ndemonstrations staged by the Bolsheviks in July 1917 were sternly\nrepressed. Many Bolshevik leaders had to go into hiding or flee.\nMeanwhile in the countryside, peasants and their Socialist\nRevolutionary leaders pressed for a redistribution of land. Land\ncommittees were formed to handle this. Encouraged by the\nSocialist Revolutionaries, peasants seized land between July and\nSeptember 1917.\nFig.9 – A Bolshevik image of Lenin\naddressing workers in April 1917.\nFig.10 – The July Days.

In September, he began discussions for an\nuprising against the government. Bolshevik supporters in the army,\nsoviets and  factories were brought together.\nOn 16 October 1917, Lenin persuaded the Petrograd Soviet and\nthe Bolshevik Party to agree to a socialist seizure of power. A\nMilitary Revolutionary Committee was appointed by the Soviet\nunder Leon Trotskii to organise the seizure. The date of the event\nwas kept a secret.\nThe uprising began on 24 October. Sensing trouble, Prime Minister\nKerenskii had left the city to summon troops. At dawn, military\nmen loyal to the government seized the buildings of two Bolshevik\nnewspapers. Pro-government troops were sent to take over telephone\nand telegraph offices and protect the Winter Palace. In a swift\nresponse, the Military Revolutionary Committee ordered its\nsupporters to seize government offices and arrest ministers. Late in\nthe day, the ship Aurora shelled the Winter Palace. Other vessels\nsailed down the Neva and took over various military points. By\nnightfall, the city was under the committee’s control and the\nministers had surrendered. At a meeting of the All Russian Congress\nof Soviets in Petrograd, the majority approved the Bolshevik action.\nUprisings took place in other cities. There was heavy fighting –\nespecially in Moscow – but by December, the Bolsheviks controlled\nthe Moscow-Petrograd area.\nFig.11 – Lenin (left) and Trotskii (right) with\nworkers at Petrograd.\nDate of the Russian Revolution\nRussia followed the Julian calendar until\n1 February 1918.

Most\nindustry and banks were nationalised in November 1917. This meant\nthat the government took over ownership and management. Land\nwas declared social property and peasants were allowed to seize the\nland of the nobility. In cities, Bolsheviks enforced the partition of\nlarge houses according to family requirements. They banned the\nuse of the old titles of aristocracy. To assert the change, new\nuniforms were designed for the army and officials, following a\nclothing competition organised in 1918 – when the Soviet hat\n(budeonovka) was chosen.\nThe Bolshevik Party was renamed the Russian Communist Party\n(Bolshevik). In November 1917, the Bolsheviks conducted the\nelections to the Constituent Assembly, but they failed to gain\nmajority support. In January 1918, the Assembly rejected Bolshevik\nmeasures and Lenin dismissed the Assembly. He thought the All\nRussian Congress of Soviets was more democratic than an assembly\nelected in uncertain conditions. In March 1918, despite opposition\nby their political allies, the Bolsheviks made peace with Germany\nat Brest Litovsk. In the years that\nfollowed, the Bolsheviks became\nthe only party to participate in the\nelections to the All Russian\nCongress of Soviets, which became\nthe Parliament of the country.\nRussia became a one-party state.\nTrade unions were kept under\nparty control. The secret police\n(called the Cheka first, and later\nOGPU and NKVD) punished\nthose \nwho \ncriticised \nthe\nBolsheviks. Many young writers\nand artists rallied to the Party\nbecause it stood for socialism and\nfor change. After October 1917,\nthis led to experiments in the arts\nand architecture. But many became\ndisillusioned because of the\ncensorship the Party encouraged.\nFig.13 – May Day demonstration in Moscow in 1918.\nFig.12 – A soldier wearing the Soviet hat\n(budeonovka).\nReprint 2025-26\nIndia and the Contemporary World\n40\nBox 3\nActivity\nThe October Revolution and the Russian Countryside: Two Views\n‘News of the revolutionary uprising of October 25, 1917, reached the village the following day and\nwas greeted with enthusiasm; to the peasants it meant free land and an end to the war. ...The day\nthe news arrived, the landowner’s manor house  was looted, his stock farms were “requisitioned”\nand his vast orchard was cut down and sold to the peasants for wood;  all his far buildings were\ntorn down and left in ruins while the land was distributed among the peasants who were prepared\nto live the new Soviet life’.\nFrom: Fedor Belov, The History of a Soviet Collective Farm\nA member of a landowning family wrote to a relative about what happened at the estate:\n‘The “coup” happened quite painlessly, quietly and peacefully. …The first days were unbearable..\nMikhail Mikhailovich [the estate owner] was calm...The girls also…I must say the chairman\nbehaves correctly and even politely.

Two Centuries of a Russian Village (1997).\n4.1 The Civil War\nWhen the Bolsheviks ordered land redistribution, the Russian army\nbegan to break up. Soldiers, mostly peasants, wished to go home for\nthe redistribution and deserted. Non-Bolshevik socialists, liberals and\nsupporters of autocracy condemned the Bolshevik uprising.  Their\nleaders moved to south Russia and organised troops to fight the\nBolsheviks (the ‘reds’). During 1918 and 1919, the ‘greens’ (Socialist\nRevolutionaries) and ‘whites’ (pro-Tsarists) controlled most of the\nRussian empire. They were backed by French, American, British\nand Japanese troops – all those forces who were worried at the growth\nof socialism in Russia. As these troops and the Bolsheviks fought a\ncivil war, looting, banditry and famine became common.\nSupporters of private property among ‘whites’ took harsh steps with\npeasants who had seized land.  Such actions led to the loss of popular\nsupport for the non-Bolsheviks. By January 1920, the Bolsheviks\ncontrolled most of the former Russian empire.

In Khiva, in Central Asia, Bolshevik colonists brutally\nmassacred local nationalists in the name of defending socialism. In\nthis situation, many were confused about what the Bolshevik\ngovernment represented.\nPartly to remedy this, most non-Russian nationalities were given\npolitical autonomy in the Soviet Union (USSR) – the state the\nBolsheviks created from the Russian empire in December 1922. But\nsince this was combined with unpopular policies that the Bolsheviks\nforced the local government to follow – like the harsh discouragement\nof nomadism – attempts to win over different nationalities were\nonly partly successful.\nCentral Asia of the October Revolution: Two Views\nM.N.Roy was an Indian revolutionary, a founder of the Mexican Communist Party\nand prominent Comintern leader in India, China and Europe.

They  permitted peasants to cultivate the land that had\nbeen socialised. Bolsheviks used confiscated land to demonstrate what\ncollective work could be.\nA process of centralised planning was introduced. Officials assessed\nhow the economy could work and set targets for a five-year period.\nOn this basis they made the Five Year Plans. The government fixed\nall prices to promote industrial growth during the first two ‘Plans’\n(1927-1932 and 1933-1938). Centralised planning led to economic\ngrowth. Industrial production increased (between 1929 and 1933 by\n100 per cent in the case of oil, coal and steel). New factory cities\ncame into being.\nHowever, rapid construction led to poor working conditions. In\nthe city of Magnitogorsk, the construction of a steel plant was achieved\nin three years. Workers lived hard lives and the result was 550\nstoppages of work in the first year alone. In living quarters, ‘in the\nwintertime, at 40 degrees below, people had to climb down from the\nfourth floor and dash across the street in order to go to the toilet’.\nAn extended schooling system developed, and arrangements were\nmade for factory workers and peasants to enter universities. Crèches\nwere established in factories for the children of women workers.\nCheap public health care was provided. Model living quarters were\nset up for workers. The effect of all this was uneven, though, since\ngovernment resources were limited.\nReprint 2025-26\nSocialism in Europe and the Russian Revolution\n43\nSource C\nDreams and Realities of a Soviet Childhood in 1933\nDear grandfather Kalinin …\nMy family is large, there are four children.

By 1927-\n1928, the towns in Soviet Russia were facing an acute\nproblem of grain supplies. The government fixed prices\nat which grain must be sold, but the  peasants refused to sell their\ngrain to government buyers at these prices.\nStalin, who headed the party after the death of Lenin, introduced\nfirm emergency measures. He believed that rich peasants and traders\nin the countryside were holding stocks in the hope of higher prices.\nSpeculation had to be stopped and supplies confiscated.\nIn 1928, Party members toured the grain-producing areas, supervising\nenforced grain collections, and raiding ‘kulaks’ –  the name for well-\nto-do peasants. As shortages continued, the decision was taken to\ncollectivise farms. It was argued that grain shortages were partly due\nto the small size of holdings. After 1917, land had been  given over to\npeasants. These small-sized peasant farms could not be modernised.\nTo develop modern farms, and run them along industrial lines with\nmachinery, it was necessary to ‘eliminate kulaks’, take away land\nfrom peasants, and establish state-controlled large farms.\nWhat followed was Stalin’s collectivisation programme. From 1929,\nthe Party forced all peasants to cultivate in collective farms (kolkhoz).\nThe bulk of land and implements were transferred to the ownership\nof collective farms. Peasants worked on the land, and the kolkhoz\nprofit was shared. Enraged peasants resisted the authorities and\ndestroyed their livestock. Between 1929 and 1931, the number of\ncattle fell by one-third. Those who resisted collectivisation were\nseverely punished. Many were deported and exiled. As they resisted\ncollectivisation, peasants argued that they were not rich and they\nwere not against socialism. They merely did not want to work in\ncollective farms for a variety of reasons. Stalin’s government allowed\nsome independent cultivation, but treated such cultivators\nunsympathetically.\nIn spite of collectivisation, production did not increase immediately.\nIn fact, the bad harvests of 1930-1933 led to one of most devastating\nfamines in Soviet history when over 4 million died.\nFig.18 – A poster during collectivisation.

However, the possibility\nof a workers’ state fired people’s imagination across the world. In\nmany countries, communist parties were formed – like the\nCommunist Party of Great Britain. The Bolsheviks encouraged\ncolonial peoples to follow their experiment. Many non-Russians from\noutside the USSR participated in the Conference of the Peoples of\nthe East (1920) and the Bolshevik-founded Comintern (an international\nunion of pro-Bolshevik socialist parties). Some received education in\nthe USSR’s Communist University of the Workers of the East. By\nthe time of the outbreak of the Second World War, the USSR had\ngiven socialism a global face and world stature.\nYet by the 1950s it was acknowledged within the country that the\nstyle of government in the USSR was not in keeping with the ideals\nof the Russian Revolution. In the world socialist movement too it\nwas recognised that all was not well in the Soviet Union. A backward\ncountry had become a great power. Its industries and agriculture\nhad developed and the poor were being fed. But it had denied the\nessential freedoms to its citizens and carried out its developmental\nprojects through repressive policies. By the end of the twentieth\ncentury, the international reputation of the USSR as a socialist\ncountry had declined though it was recognised that socialist ideals\nstill enjoyed respect among its people. But in each country the ideas\nof socialism were rethought in a variety of different ways.\n5  The Global Influence of the Russian\nRevolution and the USSR\nWriting about the Russian Revolution in India\nAmong those the Russian Revolution inspired were many Indians. Several\nattended the Communist University. By the mid-1920s the Communist Party was\nformed in India. Its members kept in touch with the Soviet Communist Party.\nImportant Indian political and cultural figures took an interest in the Soviet\nexperiment and visited Russia, among them Jawaharlal Nehru and Rabindranath\nTagore, who wrote about Soviet Socialism. In India, writings gave impressions of\nSoviet Russia. In Hindi, R.S. Avasthi wrote in 1920-21 Russian Revolution, Lenin,\nHis Life and His Thoughts, and later The Red Revolution . S.D.

In different ways all these events were important in the\nmaking of the modern world.\nChapter I is on the French Revolution. Today we often take the ideas of liberty,\nfreedom and equality for granted. But we need to remind ourselves that these ideas\nalso have a history. By looking at the French Revolution you will read a small part\nof that history. The French Revolution led to the end of monarchy in France. A\nsociety based on privileges gave way to a new system of governance. The Declaration\nof the Rights of Man during the revolution, announced the coming of a new time.\nThe idea that all individuals had rights and could claim equality became part of a\nnew language of politics. These notions of equality and freedom emerged as the central\nideas of a new age; but in different countries they were reinterpreted and rethought\nin many different ways. The anti-colonial movements in India and China, Africa and\nSouth America, produced ideas that were innovative and original, but they spoke in\na language that gained currency only from the late eighteenth century.\nIn Chapter II, you will read about the coming of socialism in Europe, and the dramatic\nevents that forced the ruling monarch, Tsar Nicholas II, to give up power. The Russian\nRevolution sought to change society in a different way. It raised the question of\neconomic equality and the well-being of workers and peasants. The chapter will tell\nyou about the changes that were initiated by the new Soviet government, the problems\nit faced and the measures it undertook. While Soviet Russia pushed ahead with\nindustrialisation and mechanisation of agriculture, it denied the rights of citizens\nthat were essential to the working of a democratic society.

Today\nthe Soviet Union has broken up and socialism is in crisis but through the twentieth\ncentury it has been a powerful force in the shaping of the contemporary world.\nChapter III will take you to Germany. It will discuss the rise of Hitler and the\npolitics of Nazism. You will read about the children and women in Nazi Germany,\nabout schools and concentration camps. You will see how Nazism denied various\nminorities a right to live, how it drew upon a long tradition of anti-Jewish feelings\nto persecute the Jews, and how it waged a relentless battle against democracy and\nsocialism. But the story of Nazism’s rise is not only about a few specific events,\nabout massacres and killings. It is about the working of an elaborate and frightening\nsystem which operated at different levels. Some in India were impressed with the\nideas of Hitler but most watched the rise of Nazism with horror.\nThe history of the modern world is not simply a story of the unfolding of freedom\nand democracy. It has also been a story of violence and tyranny, death and destruction.\nReprint 2025-26\nT h e    F r e n c h    R e v o l u t i o n\n3\nOn the morning of 14 July 1789, the city of Paris was in a state of\nalarm. The king had commanded troops to move into the city. Rumours\nspread that he would soon order the army to open fire upon the citizens.\nSome 7,000 men and women gathered in front of the town hall and\ndecided to form a peoples’ militia. They broke into a number of\ngovernment buildings in search of arms.\nFinally, a group of several hundred people marched towards the eastern\npart of the city and stormed the fortress-prison, the Bastille, where they\nhoped to find hoarded ammunition. In the armed fight that followed,\nthe commander of the Bastille was killed and the prisoners released –\nthough there were only seven of them. Yet the Bastille was hated by all,\nbecause it stood for the despotic power of the king. The fortress was\ndemolished and its stone fragments were sold in the markets to all\nthose who wished to keep a souvenir of its destruction.\nThe days that followed saw more rioting both in Paris and the\ncountryside. Most people were protesting against the high price of bread.\nMuch later, when historians looked back upon this time, they saw it as\nthe beginning of a chain of events that ultimately led to the execution\nof the king in France, though most people at the time did not anticipate\nthis outcome.

He was 20 years old and married to the Austrian\nprincess Marie Antoinette. Upon his accession the new king found\nan empty treasury. Long years of war had drained the financial\nresources of France. Added to this was the cost of maintaining an\nextravagant court at the immense palace of Versailles. Under Louis\nXVI, France helped the thirteen American colonies to gain their\nindependence from the common enemy, Britain. The war added more\nthan a billion livres to a debt that had already risen to more than 2\nbillion livres. Lenders who gave the state credit, now began to charge\n10 per cent interest on loans. So the French government was obliged\nto spend an increasing percentage of its budget on interest payments\nalone. To meet its regular expenses, such as the cost of maintaining\nan army, the court, running government offices or universities, the\nstate was forced to increase taxes. Yet even this measure would not\nhave sufficed. French society in the eighteenth century was divided\ninto three estates, and only members of the third estate paid taxes.\nThe society of estates was part of the feudal system that dated back to\nthe middle ages. The term Old Regime is usually used to describe the\nsociety and institutions of France before 1789.\nFig. 2 shows how the system of estates in French society was organised.\nPeasants made up about 90 per cent of the population. However,\nonly a small number of them owned the land they cultivated. About\n60 per cent of the land was owned by nobles, the Church and other\nricher members of the third estate. The members of the first two\nestates, that is, the clergy and the nobility, enjoyed certain privileges by\nbirth. The most important of these was exemption from paying taxes to\nthe state. The nobles further enjoyed feudal privileges. These included\nfeudal dues, which they extracted from the peasants. Peasants were obliged\nto render services to the lord – to work in his house and fields – to serve\nin the army or to participate in building roads.\nThe Church too extracted its share of taxes called tithes from the peasants,\nand finally, all members of the third estate had to pay taxes to the state.\nThese included a direct tax, called taille, and a number of indirect taxes\nwhich were levied on articles of everyday consumption like salt or tobacco.\nThe burden of financing activities of the state through taxes was borne\nby the third estate alone.\nNew words\nLivre – Unit of currency in France,\ndiscontinued in 1794\nClergy – Group of persons invested with\nspecial functions in the church\nTithe – A tax levied by the church, comprising\none-tenth of the agricultural produce\nTaille – Tax to be paid directly to the state\n1  French Society During the Late Eighteenth Century\nClergy\nNobility\nPeasants and\nartisans\nSmall peasants,\nlandless labour,\nservants\nBig businessmen,\nmerchants, court\nofficials, lawyers etc.\nFig.2 – A Society of Estates.\nNote that within the Third Estate some were\nrich and others poor.\n1st estate\n3rd estate\n2nd estate\nReprint 2025-26\nT h e    F r e n c h    R e v o l u t i o n\n5\n‘This poor fellow brings everything,\ngrain, fruits, money, salad.

This led to a rapid increase in the demand for\nfoodgrains. Production of grains could not keep pace with the\ndemand. So the price of bread which was the staple diet of the majority\nrose rapidly. Most workers were employed as labourers in workshops\nwhose owner fixed their wages. But wages did not keep pace with\nthe rise in prices. So the gap between the poor and the rich widened.\nThings became worse whenever drought or hail reduced the harvest.\nThis led to a subsistence crisis, something that occurred frequently\nin France during the Old Regime.\nNew words\nSubsistence crisis – An extreme situation where\nthe basic means of livelihood are endangered\nAnonymous – One whose name remains\nunknown\nReprint 2025-26\nIndia and the Contemporary World\n6\nActivity\n1.2 How a Subsistence Crisis Happens\nFill in the blank boxes in Fig. 4 with\nappropriate terms from among the following:\nFood riots, scarcity of grain, increased\nnumber of deaths, rising food prices,\nweaker bodies.\n1.3 A Growing Middle Class Envisages an End to Privileges\nIn the past, peasants and workers had participated in revolts against\nincreasing taxes and food scarcity. But they lacked the means and\nprogrammes to carry out full-scale measures that would bring about\na change in the social and economic order. This was left to those\ngroups within the third estate who had become prosperous and had\naccess to education and new ideas.\nThe eighteenth century witnessed the emergence of social groups,\ntermed the middle class, who earned their wealth through an\nexpanding overseas trade and from the manufacture of goods such as\nwoollen and silk textiles that were either exported or bought by the\nricher members of society. In addition to merchants and\nmanufacturers, the third estate included professions such as lawyers\nor administrative officials. All of these were educated and believed\nthat no group in society should be privileged by birth. Rather, a\nperson’s social position must depend on his merit. These ideas\nenvisaging a society based on freedom and equal laws and\nopportunities for all, were put forward by philosophers such as John\nLocke and Jean Jacques Rousseau. In his Two Treatises of  Government,\nLocke sought to refute the doctrine of the divine and absolute right\nFig.4 – The course of a subsistence crisis.\nThe poorest can no\nlonger buy bread\nBad\nharvest\nDisease\nepidemics\nReprint 2025-26\nT h e    F r e n c h    R e v o l u t i o n\n7\nSource A\nAccounts of lived experiences in the Old Regime\n1. Georges Danton, who later became active in revolutionary politics, wrote to a friend in\n1793, looking back upon the time when he had just completed his studies:\n‘I was educated in the residential college of Plessis. There I was in the company of\nimportant men … Once my studies ended, I was left with nothing. I started looking for a\npost. It was impossible to find one at the law courts in Paris. The choice of a career in the\narmy was not open to me as I was not a noble by birth, nor did I have a patron. The\nchurch too could not offer me a refuge. I could not buy an office as I did not possess a\nsou. My old friends turned their backs to me … the system had provided us with an\neducation without however offering a field where our talents could be utilised.’\n2. An Englishman, Arthur Young, travelled through France during the years from 1787 to\n1789 and wrote detailed descriptions of his journeys. He often commented on what he\nsaw.\n‘He who decides to be served and waited upon by slaves, ill-treated slaves at that, must\nbe fully aware that by doing so he is placing his property and his life in a situation which is\nvery different from that he would be in, had he chosen the services of free and well-\ntreated men. And he who chooses to dine to the accompaniment of his victims’ groans,\nshould not complain if during a riot his daughter gets kidnapped or his son’s throat is slit.’\nWhat message is Young trying to convey here? Whom does he mean when he speaks of‘ ‘slaves’?\nWho is he criticising? What dangers does he sense in the situation of 1787?\nActivity\nof the monarch. Rousseau carried the idea forward, proposing a\nform of government based on a social contract between people\nand their representatives. In The Spirit of the Laws, Montesquieu\nproposed a division of power within the government between\nthe legislative, the executive and the judiciary. This model of\ngovernment was put into force in the USA, after the thirteen\ncolonies declared their independence from Britain. The American\nconstitution and its guarantee of individual rights was an important\nexample for political thinkers in France.\nThe ideas of these philosophers were discussed intensively in salons\nand coffee-houses and spread among people through books and\nnewspapers. These were frequently read aloud in groups for the\nbenefit of those who could not read and write. The news that\nLouis XVI planned to impose further taxes to be able to meet the\nexpenses of the state generated anger and protest against the system\nof privileges.\nSource\nReprint 2025-26\nIndia and the Contemporary World\n8\nLouis XVI had to increase taxes for reasons you have learnt in the\nprevious section. How do you think he could have gone about doing\nthis? In France of the Old Regime the monarch did not have the\npower to impose taxes according to his will alone. Rather he had to\ncall a meeting of the Estates General which would then pass his\nproposals for new taxes. The Estates General was a political body to\nwhich the three estates sent their representatives. However, the\nmonarch alone could decide when to call a meeting of this body. The\nlast time it was done was in 1614.\nOn 5 May 1789, Louis XVI called together an assembly of the Estates\nGeneral to pass proposals for new taxes. A resplendent hall in\nVersailles was prepared to host the delegates. The first and second\nestates sent 300 representatives each, who were seated in rows facing\neach other on two sides, while the 600 members of the third estate\nhad to stand at the back. The third estate was represented by its more\nprosperous and educated members. Peasants, artisans and women\nwere denied entry to the assembly. However, their grievances and\ndemands were listed in some 40,000 letters which the representatives\nhad brought with them.\nVoting in the Estates General in the past had been conducted according\nto the principle that each estate had one vote. This time too Louis\nXVI was determined to continue the same practice. But members of\nthe third estate demanded that voting now be conducted by the\nassembly as a  whole, where each member would have one vote. This\nwas one of the democratic principles put forward by philosophers\nlike Rousseau in his book The Social Contract. When the king rejected\nthis proposal, members of the third estate walked out of the assembly\nin protest.\nThe representatives of the third estate viewed themselves as spokesmen\nfor the whole French nation. On 20 June they assembled in the hall\nof an indoor tennis court in the grounds of Versailles. They declared\nthemselves a National Assembly and swore not to disperse till they\nhad drafted a constitution for France that would limit the powers of\nthe monarch. They were led by Mirabeau and Abbé Sieyès. Mirabeau\nwas born in a noble family but was convinced of the need to do away\nwith a society of feudal privilege. He brought out a journal and\ndelivered powerful speeches to the crowds assembled at Versailles.\n2  The Outbreak of the Revolution\nActivity\nRepresentatives of the Third Estate take the\noath raising their arms in the direction of\nBailly, the President of the Assembly,\nstanding on a table in the centre.

A severe winter\nhad meant a bad harvest; the price of bread rose, often bakers exploited\nthe situation and hoarded supplies. After spending hours in long\nqueues at the bakery, crowds of angry women stormed into the\nshops. At the same time, the king ordered troops to move into Paris.\nOn 14 July, the agitated crowd stormed and destroyed the Bastille.\nIn the countryside rumours spread from village to village that the\nlords of the manor had hired bands of brigands who were on their\nway to destroy the ripe crops. Caught in a frenzy of fear, peasants in\nseveral districts seized hoes and pitchforks and attacked chateaux.\nThey looted hoarded grain and burnt down documents containing\nrecords of manorial dues. A large number of nobles fled from their\nhomes, many of them migrating to neighbouring countries.\nFaced with the power of his revolting subjects, Louis XVI finally\naccorded recognition to the National Assembly and accepted the\nprinciple that his powers would from now on be checked by a\nconstitution. On the night of 4 August 1789, the Assembly passed a\ndecree abolishing the feudal system of obligations and taxes. Members\nof the clergy too were forced to give up their privileges. Tithes were\nabolished and lands owned by the Church were confiscated.

Its main object was to limit the powers of the monarch. These\npowers instead of being concentrated in the hands of one person,\nwere now separated and assigned to different institutions – the\nlegislature, executive and judiciary. This made France a constitutional\nmonarchy. Fig. 7 explains how the new political system worked.\nThe Constitution of 1791 vested the power to make laws in the\nNational Assembly, which was indirectly elected. That is, citizens\nvoted for a group of electors, who in turn chose the Assembly. Not\nall citizens, however, had the right to vote. Only men above 25 years\nof age who paid taxes equal to at least 3 days of a labourer’s wage\nwere given the status of active citizens, that is, they were entitled to\nvote. The remaining men and all women were classed as passive\ncitizens. To qualify as an elector and then as a member of the Assembly,\na man had to belong to the highest bracket of taxpayers.\nFig.7 – The Political sytstem under the Constitution of 1791.\nJudiciary\nExecutive\nLegislature\nJudge\nKing\nNational Assembly (745 members)\nElectors (50,000 men)\nMinisters\nActive citizens: entitled to vote.

Rights such as the right to life, freedom of speech,\nfreedom of opinion, equality before law, were established as ‘natural\nand inalienable’ rights, that is, they belonged to each human being\nby birth and could not be taken away. It was the duty of the state to\nprotect each citizen’s natural rights.\nThe revolutionary journalist Jean-Paul\nMarat commented in his newspaper\nL’Ami du peuple (The friend of the\npeople) on the Constitution drafted by\nthe National Assembly:\n‘The task of representing the people\nhas been given to the rich … the lot of\nthe poor and oppressed will never be\nimproved by peaceful means alone.

Rulers of other neighbouring\ncountries too were worried by the developments in France and made\nplans to send troops to put down the events that had been taking place\nthere since the summer of 1789. Before this could happen, the National\nAssembly voted in April 1792 to declare war against Prussia and Austria.\nThousands of volunteers thronged from the provinces to join the army.\nThey saw this as a war of the people against kings and aristocracies all\nover Europe. Among the patriotic songs they sang was the Marseillaise,\ncomposed by the poet Roget de L’Isle. It was sung for the first time by\nvolunteers from Marseilles as they marched into Paris and so got its\nname. The Marseillaise is now the national anthem of France.\nThe revolutionary wars brought losses and economic difficulties\nto the people. While the men were away fighting at the front,\nwomen were left to cope with the tasks of earning a living and\nlooking after their families. Large sections of the population were\nconvinced that the revolution had to be carried further, as the\nConstitution of 1791 gave political rights only to the richer sections\nof society. Political clubs became an important rallying point for\npeople who wished to discuss government policies and plan their\nown forms of action. The most successful of these clubs was that of\nthe Jacobins, which got its name from the former convent of St\nJacob in Paris. Women too, who had been active throughout this\nperiod, formed their own clubs. Section 4 of this chapter will tell\nyou more about their activities and demands.\nThe members of the Jacobin club belonged mainly to the less\nprosperous sections of society. They included small shopkeepers,\nartisans such as shoemakers, pastry cooks, watch-makers, printers,\nas well as servants and daily-wage workers. Their leader was\nMaximilian Robespierre. A large group among the Jacobins decided\nto start wearing long striped trousers similar to those worn by\ndock workers. This was to set themselves apart from the fashionable\nsections of society, especially nobles, who wore knee breeches.

These Jacobins came to be known as the\nsans-culottes, literally meaning ‘those without knee breeches’. Sans-\nculottes men wore in addition the red cap that symbolised liberty.\nWomen however were not allowed to do so.\nIn the summer of 1792 the Jacobins planned an insurrection of a\nlarge number of Parisians who were angered by the short supplies\nand high prices of food. On the morning of August 10 they stormed\nthe Palace of the Tuileries, massacred the king’s guards and held\nthe king himself as hostage for several hours.

We must annihilate the\nenemies of the republic at home and abroad,\nor else we shall perish.

The queen Marie Antoinette met with the\nsame fate shortly after.\n3.1 The Reign of Terror\nThe period from 1793 to 1794 is referred to as the Reign of\nTerror. Robespierre followed a policy of severe control and\npunishment. All those whom he saw as being ‘enemies’ of the\nrepublic – ex-nobles and clergy, members of other political\nparties, even members of his own party who did not agree with\nhis methods – were arrested, imprisoned and then tried by a\nrevolutionary tribunal. If the court found them ‘guilty’ they\nwere guillotined. The guillotine is a device consisting of two\npoles and a blade with which a person is beheaded. It was named\nafter Dr Guillotin who invented it.\nRobespierre’s government issued laws placing a maximum ceiling\non wages and prices. Meat and bread were rationed. Peasants\nwere forced to transport their grain to the cities and sell it at\nprices fixed by the government. The use of more expensive white\nflour was forbidden; all citizens were required to eat the pain\nd’égalité (equality bread), a loaf made of wholewheat. Equality\nwas also sought to be practised through forms of speech and\naddress. Instead of the traditional Monsieur (Sir) and Madame\n(Madam) all French men and women were henceforth Citoyen\nand Citoyenne (Citizen). Churches were shut down and their\nbuildings converted into barracks or offices.\nRobespierre pursued his policies so relentlessly that even his\nsupporters began to demand moderation. Finally, he was\nconvicted by a court in July 1794, arrested and on the next day\nsent to the guillotine.\nReprint 2025-26\nT h e    F r e n c h    R e v o l u t i o n\n17\nFig.11 – The revolutionary government sought to mobilise the loyalty of its subjects through various means – one of\nthem was the staging of festivals like this one.

A new constitution was introduced which\ndenied the vote to non-propertied sections of society. It provided\nfor two elected legislative councils. These then appointed a Directory,\nan executive made up of five members. This was meant as a safeguard\nagainst the concentration of power in a one-man executive as under\nthe Jacobins. However, the Directors often clashed with the legislative\ncouncils, who then sought to dismiss them. The political instability\nof the Directory paved the way for the rise of a military dictator,\nNapoleon Bonaparte.\nThrough all these changes in the form of government, the ideals of\nfreedom, of equality before the law and of fraternity remained inspiring\nideals that motivated political movements in France and the rest of Europe\nduring the following century.\nReprint 2025-26\nIndia and the Contemporary World\n18\n44444     Did Women have a Revolution?\nDid Women have a Revolution?\nDid Women have a Revolution?\nDid Women have a Revolution?\nDid Women have a Revolution?\nFig.12 – Parisian women on their way to Versailles.\nThis print is one of the many pictorial representations of the events of 5 October 1789, when women marched to Versailles\nand brought the king back with them to Paris.\nFrom the very beginning women were active participants in the events\nwhich brought about so many important changes in French society.\nThey hoped that their involvement would pressurise the revolutionary\ngovernment to introduce measures to improve their lives. Most\nwomen of the third estate had to work for a living. They worked as\nseamstresses or laundresses, sold flowers, fruits and vegetables at the\nmarket, or were employed as domestic servants in the houses of\nprosperous people. Most women did not have access to education or\njob training. Only daughters of nobles or wealthier members of the\nthird estate could study at a convent, after which their families\narranged a marriage for them. Working women had also to care for\ntheir families, that is, cook, fetch water, queue up for bread and\nlook after the children. Their wages were lower than those of men.\nIn order to discuss and voice their interests women started their own\npolitical clubs and newspapers.

Women were disappointed that the Constitution of 1791 reduced\nthem to passive citizens. They demanded the right to vote, to be\nelected to the Assembly and to hold political office. Only then, they\nfelt, would their interests be represented in the new government.\nIn the early years, the revolutionary government did introduce laws\nthat helped improve the lives of women. Together with the creation\nof state schools, schooling was made compulsory for all girls. Their\nfathers could no longer force them into marriage against their will.\nMarriage was made into a contract entered into freely and registered\nunder civil law. Divorce was made legal, and could be applied for by\nboth women and men. Women could now train for jobs, could\nbecome artists or run small businesses.\nWomen’s struggle for equal political rights, however, continued.\nDuring the Reign of Terror, the new government issued laws ordering\nclosure of women’s clubs and banning their political activities. Many\nprominent women were arrested and a number of them executed.\nWomen’s movements for voting rights and equal wages continued\nthrough the next two hundred years in many countries of the world.\nThe fight for the vote was carried out through an international\nsuffrage movement during the late nineteenth and early twentieth\ncenturies. The example of the political activities of French women\nduring the revolutionary years was kept alive as an inspiring memory.\nIt was finally in 1946 that women in France won the right to vote.\nThe life of a revolutionary woman – Olympe de Gouges\n(1748-1793)\nOlympe de Gouges was one of the most important of the politically\nactive women in revolutionary France. She protested against the\nConstitution and the Declaration of Rights of Man and Citizen as\nthey excluded women from basic rights that each human being was\nentitled to. So, in 1791, she wrote a Declaration of the Rights of\nWoman and Citizen, which she addressed to the Queen and to the\nmembers of the National Assembly, demanding that they act upon\nit. In 1793, Olympe de Gouges criticised the Jacobin government\nfor forcibly closing down women’s clubs. She was tried by the\nNational Convention, which charged her with treason.

The colonies in\nthe Caribbean – Martinique, Guadeloupe and San Domingo – were\nimportant suppliers of commodities such as tobacco, indigo, sugar\nand coffee. But the reluctance of Europeans to go and work in distant\nand unfamiliar lands meant a shortage of labour on the plantations.\nSo this was met by a triangular slave trade between Europe, Africa\nand the Americas. The slave trade began in the seventeenth century.\nFrench merchants sailed from the ports of Bordeaux or Nantes to\nthe African coast, where they bought slaves from local chieftains.\nBranded and shackled, the slaves were packed tightly into ships for\nthe three-month long voyage across the Atlantic to the Caribbean.\nThere they were sold to plantation owners. The exploitation of slave\nlabour made it possible to meet the growing demand in European\nmarkets for sugar, coffee, and indigo. Port cities like Bordeaux and\nNantes owed their economic prosperity to the flourishing slave trade.\nThroughout the eighteenth century there was little criticism of slavery\nin France. The National Assembly held long debates about whether\nthe rights of man should be extended to all French subjects including\nthose in the colonies. But it did not pass any laws, fearing opposition\nfrom businessmen whose incomes depended on the slave trade. It\nwas finally the Convention which in 1794 legislated to free all slaves\nin the French overseas possessions. This, however, turned out to be\na short-term measure: ten years later, Napoleon reintroduced slavery.\nPlantation owners understood their freedom as including the right\nto enslave African Negroes in pursuit of their economic interests.\nSlavery was finally abolished in French colonies in 1848.\nFig.14 – The emancipation of slaves.\nThis print of 1794 describes the emancipation\nof slaves.

The years following 1789 in France saw many\nsuch changes in the lives of men, women and children. The\nrevolutionary governments took it upon themselves to pass laws that\nwould translate the ideals of liberty and equality into everyday practice.\nOne important law that came into effect soon after the storming of\nthe Bastille in the summer of 1789 was the abolition of censorship. In\nthe Old Regime all written material and cultural activities – books,\nnewspapers, plays – could be published or performed only after they\nhad been approved by the censors of the king. Now the Declaration\nof the Rights of Man and Citizen proclaimed freedom of speech and\nexpression to be a natural right. Newspapers, pamphlets, books and\nprinted pictures flooded the towns of France from where they\ntravelled rapidly into the countryside. They all described and discussed\nthe events and changes taking place in France. Freedom of the press\nalso meant that opposing views of events could be expressed. Each\nside sought to convince the others of its position through the medium\nof print. Plays, songs and festive processions attracted large numbers\nof people.

He introduced many\nlaws such as the protection of private property and a uniform system of\nweights and measures provided by the decimal system. Initially, many\nsaw Napoleon as a liberator who would bring freedom for the people.\nBut soon the Napoleonic armies came to be viewed everywhere as an\ninvading force. He was finally defeated at Waterloo in 1815. Many of his\nmeasures that carried the revolutionary ideas of liberty and modern laws\nto other parts of Europe had an impact on people long after Napoleon\nhad left.\nThe ideas of liberty and democratic rights were the most important\nlegacy of the French Revolution.

As if their\nlives do not matter. As if they are figures from the past who have no\nplace in modern society.\nIn this chapter you will see how pastoralism has been important in\nsocieties like India and Africa.

During the hot\nweather the Gujjars usually drive their\nherds to the upper range, where the\nbuffaloes rejoice in the rich grass which\nthe rains bring forth and at the same\ntime attain condition from the\ntemperate climate and the immunity\nfrom venomous flies that torment their\nexistence in the plains.’\nFrom: G.C.

On the\nway they stopped once again in the villages of Lahul and Spiti, reaping\ntheir summer harvest and sowing their winter crop. Then they descended\nwith their flock to their winter grazing ground on the Siwalik hills.\nNext April, once again, they began their march with their goats and\nsheep, to the summer meadows.\nFurther to the east, in Garhwal and Kumaon, the Gujjar cattle herders\ncame down to the  dry forests of the bhabar in the\nwinter, and went up to the high meadows – the\nbugyals – in summer. Many of them were\noriginally from Jammu and came to the UP hills in\nthe nineteenth century in search of good pastures.\nThis pattern of cyclical movement between summer\nand winter pastures was typical of many pastoral\ncommunities of the Himalayas, including the\nBhotiyas, Sherpas and Kinnauris. All of them had\nto adjust to seasonal changes and make effective use\nof available pastures in different places. When the\npasture was exhausted or unusable in one place they\nmoved their herds and flock to new areas. This\ncontinuous movement also allowed the pastures to\nrecover; it prevented their overuse.\nFig.4 – Gaddi sheep being sheared.\nBy September the Gaddi shepherds come down from the high\nmeadows (Dhars).

They were also to be\nfound in the plateaus, plains and deserts of India.\nDhangars were an important pastoral community of Maharashtra.\nIn the early twentieth century their population in this region was\nestimated to be 467,000. Most of them were shepherds, some were\nblanket weavers, and still others were buffalo herders. The Dhangar\nshepherds stayed in the central plateau of Maharashtra during the\nmonsoon. This was a semi-arid region with low rainfall and poor\nsoil. It was covered with thorny scrub. Nothing but dry crops like\nbajra could be sown here. In the monsoon this tract became a vast\ngrazing ground for the Dhangar flocks. By October the Dhangars\nharvested their bajra and started on their move west. After a march\nof about a month they reached the Konkan. This was a flourishing\nagricultural tract with high rainfall and rich soil. Here the shepherds\nwere welcomed by Konkani peasants. After the kharif harvest was\ncut at this time, the fields had to be fertilised and made ready for the\nrabi harvest. Dhangar flocks manured the fields and fed on the\nstubble. The Konkani peasants also gave supplies of rice which the\nshepherds took back to the plateau where grain was scarce. With the\nonset of the monsoon the Dhangars left the Konkan and the coastal\nareas with their flocks and returned to their settlements on the dry\nplateau. The sheep could not tolerate the wet monsoon conditions.\nNew words\nKharif – The autumn crop, usually harvested\nbetween September and October\nRabi – The spring crop, usually harvested\nafter March\nStubble – Lower ends of grain stalks left in\nthe ground after harvesting\nFig.5 – Raika camels grazing\non the Thar desert in western\nRajasthan.\nOnly camels can survive on the\ndry and thorny bushes that can\nbe found here; but to get\nenough feed they have to graze\nover a very extensive area.\nReprint 2025-26\nPastoralists in the Modern World\n101\nActivity\nSource B\nIn Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh, again, the dry central plateau was\ncovered with stone and grass, inhabited by cattle, goat and sheep\nherders. The Gollas herded cattle. The Kurumas and Kurubas reared\nsheep and goats and sold woven blankets. They lived near the woods,\ncultivated small patches of land, engaged in a variety of petty trades\nand took care of their herds. Unlike the mountain pastoralists, it\nwas not the cold and the snow that defined the seasonal rhythms of\ntheir movement: rather it was the alternation of the monsoon and\ndry season. In the dry season they moved to the coastal tracts, and\nleft when the rains came. Only buffaloes liked the swampy, wet\nconditions of the coastal areas during the monsoon months. Other\nherds had to be shifted to the dry plateau at this time.\nBanjaras were yet another well-known group of graziers. They were\nto be found in the villages of Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Rajasthan,\nMadhya Pradesh and Maharashtra. In search of good pastureland\nfor their cattle, they moved over long distances, selling plough cattle\nand other goods to villagers in exchange for grain and fodder.\nThe accounts of many travellers tell us about the life of pastoral\ngroups. In the early nineteenth century, Buchanan visited the\nGollas during his travel through Mysore. He wrote:\n‘Their families live in small villages near the skirt of the woods,\nwhere they cultivate a little ground, and keep some of their\ncattle, selling in the towns the produce of the dairy.\nTheir families are very numerous, seven to eight young men in\neach being common. Two or three of these attend the flocks in\nthe woods, while the remainder cultivate their fields, and supply\nthe towns with firewood, and with straw for thatch.’\nFrom: Francis Hamilton Buchanan, A Journey from Madras through\nthe Countries of Mysore, Canara and Malabar (London, 1807).\nRead Sources A and B.\nØ Write briefly about what they tell you about\nthe nature of the work undertaken by men\nand women in pastoral households.\nØ Why do you think pastoral groups often\nlive on the edges of forests?\nIn the deserts of Rajasthan lived the Raikas. The rainfall in\nthe region was meagre and uncertain. On cultivated land,\nharvests fluctuated every year. Over vast stretches no crop\ncould be grown. So the Raikas combined cultivation with\npastoralism. During  the monsoons, the Raikas of  Barmer,\nJaisalmer, Jodhpur and Bikaner stayed in their home villages,\nwhere pasture was available. By October, when these grazing\ngrounds were dry and exhausted, they moved out in search\nof other pasture and water, and returned again during the\nnext monsoon. One group of Raikas – known as the Maru\n(desert) Raikas – herded camels and another group reared\nsheep and goat.\nFig.6 – A camel herder in his settlement.\nThis is on the Thar desert near Jaisalmer in Rajasthan.\nThe camel herders of the region are Maru (desert)\nRaikas, and their settlement is called a dhandi.\nReprint 2025-26\nIndia and the Contemporary World\n102\nSo we see that the life of these pastoral groups was sustained by a\ncareful consideration of a host of factors. They had to judge how\nlong the herds could stay in one area, and know where they could\nfind water and pasture. They needed to calculate the timing of their\nmovements, and ensure that they could move through different\nterritories. They had to set up a relationship with farmers on the\nway, so that the herds could graze in harvested fields and manure the\nsoil. They combined a range of different activities – cultivation, trade,\nand herding – to make their living.\nHow did the life of pastoralists change under colonial rule?\nFig.7 – A camel fair at Balotra in western Rajasthan.

Their agricultural stock\ndeclined and their trades and crafts were adversely affected. How?\nFirst, the colonial state wanted to transform all grazing lands\ninto cultivated farms. Land revenue was one of the main sources\nof its finance. By expanding cultivation it could increase its revenue\ncollection. It could at the same time produce more jute, cotton,\nwheat and other agricultural produce that were required in\nEngland. To colonial officials all uncultivated land appeared to\nbe unproductive: it produced neither revenue nor agricultural\nproduce. It was seen as ‘waste land’ that needed to be brought\nunder cultivation. From the mid-nineteenth century, Waste Land\nRules were enacted in various parts of the country. By these Rules\nuncultivated lands were taken over and given to select individuals.\nThese individuals were granted various concessions and encouraged\nto settle these lands. Some of them were made headmen of villages\nin the newly cleared areas. In most areas the lands taken over\nwere actually grazing tracts used regularly by pastoralists. So\nexpansion of cultivation inevitably meant the decline of pastures\nand a problem for pastoralists.\nSecond, by the mid-nineteenth century, various Forest Acts were\nalso being enacted in the different provinces.  Through these Acts\nsome forests which produced commercially valuable timber like\ndeodar or sal were declared ‘Reserved’. No pastoralist was allowed\naccess to these forests. Other forests were classified as ‘Protected’.\nIn these, some customary grazing rights of pastoralists were\ngranted but their movements were severely restricted. The\ncolonial officials believed that grazing destroyed the saplings and\nyoung shoots of trees that germinated on the forest floor. The\nherds trampled over the saplings and munched away the shoots.\nThis prevented new trees from growing.\nThese Forest Acts changed the lives of pastoralists. They were\nnow prevented from entering many forests that had earlier\nprovided valuable forage for their cattle. Even in the areas they\nwere allowed entry, their movements were regulated. They needed\na permit for entry. The timing of their entry and departure was\n22222 Colonial \n Colonial \n Colonial \n Colonial \n Colonial RRRRRule and \nule and \nule and \nule and \nule and PPPPPastoral \nastoral \nastoral \nastoral \nastoral LLLLLife\nife\nife\nife\nife\nH.S.

Pastoralists could no longer remain in an area even if\nforage was available, the grass was succulent and the undergrowth\nin the forest was ample. They had to move because the Forest\nDepartment permits that had been issued to them now ruled their\nlives. The permit specified the periods in which they could be\nlegally within a forest. If they overstayed they were liable to fines.\nThird, British officials were suspicious of nomadic people. They\ndistrusted mobile craftsmen and traders who hawked their goods\nin villages, and pastoralists who changed their places of residence\nevery season, moving in search of good pastures for their herds.\nThe colonial government wanted to rule over a settled population.\nThey wanted the rural people to live in villages, in fixed places\nwith fixed rights on particular fields. Such a population was easy\nto identify and control. Those who were settled were seen as\npeaceable and law abiding; those who were nomadic were\nconsidered to be criminal. In 1871, the colonial government in\nIndia passed the Criminal Tribes Act.  By this Act many\ncommunities of craftsmen, traders and pastoralists were classified\nas Criminal Tribes. They were stated to be criminal by nature\nand birth. Once this Act came into force, these communities were\nexpected to live only in notified village settlements. They were\nnot allowed to move out without a permit. The village police\nkept a continuous watch on them.\nFourth, to expand its revenue income, the colonial government\nlooked for every possible source of taxation. So tax was imposed\non land, on canal water, on salt, on trade goods, and even on\nanimals. Pastoralists had to pay tax on every animal they grazed\non the pastures. In most pastoral tracts of India, grazing tax was\nintroduced in the mid-nineteenth century. The tax per head of\ncattle went up rapidly and the system of collection was made\nincreasingly efficient. In the decades between the 1850s and 1880s\nthe right to collect the tax was auctioned out to contractors. These\ncontractors tried to extract as high a tax as they could to recover\nthe money they had paid to the state and earn as much profit as\nthey could within the year. By the 1880s the government began\ncollecting taxes directly from the pastoralists. Each of them was\ngiven a pass. To enter a grazing tract, a cattle herder had to show\nthe pass and pay the tax. The number of cattle heads he had and\nthe amount of tax he paid was entered on the pass.\nIn the 1920s, a Royal Commission on\nAgriculture reported:\n‘The extent of the area available for\ngrazing has gone down tremendously\nwith the extension of area under\ncultivation because of increasing\npopulation, extension of irrigation\nfacilities, acquiring the pastures for\nGovernment purposes, for example,\ndefence, industries and agricultural\nexperimental farms. [Now] breeders find\nit difficult to raise large herds. Thus their\nearnings have gone down. The quality\nof their livestock has deteriorated,\ndietary standards have fallen and\nindebtedness has increased.’\nThe Report of the Royal Commission of\nAgriculture in India, 1928.\nImagine you are living in the 1890s.\nYou belong to a community of nomadic\npastoralists and craftsmen.

When grazing\nlands were taken over and turned into cultivated fields, the available\narea of pastureland declined. Similarly, the reservation of forests\nmeant that shepherds and cattle herders could no longer freely pasture\ntheir cattle in the forests.\nAs pasturelands disappeared under the plough, the existing animal\nstock had to feed on whatever grazing land remained. This led to\ncontinuous intensive grazing of these pastures. Usually nomadic\npastoralists grazed their animals in one area and moved to another\narea. These pastoral movements allowed time for the natural\nrestoration of vegetation growth. When restrictions were imposed\non pastoral movements, grazing lands came to be continuously used\nand the quality of patures declined. This in turn created a further\nshortage of forage for animals and the deterioration of animal stock.\nUnderfed cattle died in large numbers during scarcities and famines.\nFig.11 – Pastoralists in India.\nThis map indicates the location of only those\npastoral communities mentioned in the\nchapter. There are many others living in\nvarious parts of India.\nReprint 2025-26\nPastoralists in the Modern World\n107\n2.2 How Did the Pastoralists Cope with these Changes?\nPastoralists reacted to these changes in a variety of ways. Some\nreduced the number of cattle in their herds, since there was not\nenough pasture to feed large numbers. Others discovered new\npastures when movement to old grazing grounds became difficult.\nAfter 1947, the camel and sheep herding Raikas, for instance, could\nno longer move into Sindh and graze their camels on the banks of\nthe Indus, as they had done earlier. The new political boundaries\nbetween India and Pakistan stopped their movement. So they had\nto find new places to go. In recent years they have been migrating\nto Haryana where sheep can graze on agricultural fields after the\nharvests are cut. This is the time that the fields need manure that\nthe animals provide.\nOver the years, some richer pastoralists began buying land and\nsettling down, giving up their nomadic life. Some became settled\npeasants cultivating land, others took to more extensive trading.\nMany poor pastoralists, on the other hand, borrowed money from\nmoneylenders to survive. At times they lost their cattle and sheep\nand became labourers, working on fields or in small towns.\nYet, pastoralists not only continue to survive, in many regions\ntheir numbers have expanded over recent decades. When\npasturelands in one place was closed to them, they changed the\ndirection of their movement, reduced the size of the herd, combined\npastoral activity with other forms of income and adapted to the\nchanges in the modern world. Many ecologists believe that in dry\nregions and in the mountains, pastoralism is still ecologically the\nmost viable form of life.\nSuch changes were not  experienced only  by pastoral communities\nin India. In many other parts of the world, new laws and settlement\npatterns forced pastoral communities to alter their lives. How did\npastoral communities elsewhere cope with these changes in the\nmodern world?\nReprint 2025-26\nIndia and the Contemporary World\n108\nLet us move to Africa where over half the world’s pastoral population\nlives. Even today, over 22 million Africans depend on some form of\npastoral activity for their livelihood. They include communities like\nBedouins, Berbers, Maasai, Somali, Boran and Turkana. Most of\nthem now live in the semi-arid grasslands or arid deserts where rainfed\nagriculture is difficult. They raise cattle, camels, goats, sheep and\ndonkeys; and they sell milk, meat, animal skin and wool. Some also\nearn through trade and transport, others combine pastoral activity\nwith agriculture; still others do a variety of odd jobs to supplement\ntheir meagre and uncertain earnings from pastoralism.\nLike pastoralists in India, the lives of African pastoralists have changed\ndramatically over the colonial and post-colonial periods.

Courtesy: The Massai Association.\nReprint 2025-26\nPastoralists in the Modern World\n109\nWe will discuss some of these changes by looking at one pastoral\ncommunity – the Maasai – in some detail. The Maasai cattle herders\nlive primarily in east Africa: 300, 000 in southern Kenya and another\n150,000 in Tanzania. We will see how new laws and regulations took\naway their land and restricted their movement. This affected their\nlives in times of drought and even reshaped their social relationships.\n3.1 Where have the Grazing Lands Gone?\nOne of the problems the Maasais have faced is the continuous loss of\ntheir grazing lands. Before colonial times, Maasailand stretched over\na vast area from north Kenya to the steppes of northern Tanzania.\nIn the late nineteenth century, European imperial powers scrambled\nfor territorial possessions in Africa, slicing up the region into different\ncolonies. In 1885, Maasailand was cut into half with an international\nboundary between British Kenya and German Tanganyika.\nSubsequently, the best grazing lands were gradually taken over for\nwhite settlement and the Maasai were pushed into a small area in\nFig.13 – Pastoral communities in Africa.\nThe inset shows the location of the Maasais in Kenya and Tanzania.\nOn Tanganyika\nBritain conquered what had been German East\nAfrica during the First World War. In 1919\nTanganyika came under British control. It\nattained independence in 1961 and united with\nZanzibar to form Tanzania in 1964.\nReprint 2025-26\nIndia and the Contemporary World\n110\nsouth Kenya and north Tanzania. The Maasai lost about 60 per cent\nof their pre-colonial lands. They were confined to an arid zone with\nuncertain rainfall and poor pastures.\nFrom the late nineteenth century, the British colonial government\nin east Africa also encouraged local peasant communities to expand\ncultivation. As cultivation expanded, pasturelands were turned into\ncultivated fields. In pre-colonial times, the Maasai pastoralists had\ndominated their agricultural neighbours both economically and\npolitically. By the end of colonial rule the situation had reversed.\nLarge areas of grazing land were also turned into game reserves like\nthe Maasai Mara and Samburu National Park in Kenya and Serengeti\nPark in Tanzania. Pastoralists were not allowed to enter these\nreserves; they could neither hunt animals nor graze their herds in\nthese areas. Very often these reserves were in areas that had\ntraditionally been regular grazing grounds for Maasai herds. The\nSerengeti National Park, for instance, was created over 14,760 km.\nof Maasai grazing land.\nFig.14 – Without grass, livestock (cattle, goats and sheep) are malnourished, which means less food available for families\nand their children. The areas hardest hit by drought and food shortage  are in the vicinity of Amboseli National Park, which\nlast year generated approximately 240 million Kenyan Shillings (estimated $3.5 million US) from tourism.

All this was stopped with\nthe new system of territorial boundaries that restricted\nmovements between regions.\nThe nomadic cattle herders of Kaokoland in Namibia\ncomplained:\n‘We have difficulty. We cry. We are imprisoned. We do not know\nwhy we are locked up. We are in jail. We have no place to live\n… We cannot get meat from the south … Our sleeping skins\ncannot be sent out … Ovamboland is closed for us. We lived in\nOvamboland for a long time. We want to take our cattle there,\nalso our sheep and goats. The borders are closed. The borders\npress us heavily. We cannot live.’\nStatement of Kaokoland herders, Namibia, 1949.\nQuoted in Michael Bollig, ‘The colonial encapsulation of the north\nwestern Namibian pastoral economy’, Africa 68 (4), 1998.\nFig.15 – The title Maasai derives from the word Maa.

Courtesy: The Massai Association.\nReprint 2025-26\nIndia and the Contemporary World\n112\nThe loss of the finest grazing lands and water resources created\npressure on the small area of land that the Maasai were confined\nwithin. Continuous grazing within a small area inevitably meant a\ndeterioration of the quality of pastures. Fodder was always in short\nsupply. Feeding the cattle became a persistent problem.\n3.2 The Borders are Closed\nIn the nineteenth century, African pastoralists could move over vast\nareas in search of pastures. When the pastures were exhausted in one\nplace they moved to a different area to graze their cattle. From the\nlate nineteenth century, the colonial government began imposing\nvarious restrictions on their mobility.\nLike the Maasai, other pastoral groups were also forced to live within\nthe confines of special reserves. The boundaries of these reserves\nbecame the limits within which they could now move. They were\nnot allowed to move out with their stock without special permits.\nAnd it was difficult to get permits without trouble and harassment.\nThose found guilty of disobeying the rules were severely punished.\nPastoralists were also not allowed to enter the markets in white areas.\nIn many regions, they were prohibited from participating in any\nform of trade. White settlers and European colonists saw pastoralists\nas dangerous and savage – people with whom all contact had to be\nminimised. Cutting off all links was, however, never really possible,\nbecause white colonists had to depend on black labour to bore mines\nand, build roads and towns.\nThe new territorial boundaries and restrictions imposed on them\nsuddenly changed the lives of pastoralists. This adversely affected\nSource F\nIn most places in colonial Africa, the police were given instructions to keep a\nwatch on the movements of  pastoralists, and prevent them from entering white\nareas. The following is one such instruction given by a magistrate to the police,\nin south-west Africa, restricting the movements of the pastoralists of Kaokoland\nin Namibia:\n‘Passes to enter the Territory should not be given to these Natives unless\nexceptional circumstances necessitate their entering … The object of the above\nproclamation is to restrict the number of natives entering the Territory and to\nkeep a check on them, and ordinary visiting passes should therefore never be\nissued to them.’\n‘Kaokoveld permits to enter’, Magistrate to Police Station Commanders of Outjo\nand Kamanjab, 24 November, 1937.\nSource\nReprint 2025-26\nPastoralists in the Modern World\n113\nboth their pastoral and trading activities. Earlier, pastoralists not\nonly looked after animal herds but traded in various products. The\nrestrictions under colonial rule did not entirely stop their trading\nactivities but they were now subject to various restrictions.\n3.3 When Pastures Dry\nDrought affects the life of pastoralists everywhere. When rains fail\nand pastures are dry, cattle are likely to starve unless they can be\nmoved to areas where forage is available. That is why, traditionally,\npastoralists are nomadic; they move from place to place. This\nnomadism allows them to survive bad times and avoid crises.\nBut from the colonial period, the Maasai were bound down to a\nfixed area, confined within a reserve, and prohibited from moving\nin search of pastures. They were cut off from the best grazing lands\nand forced to live within a semi-arid tract prone to frequent droughts.\nSince they could not shift their cattle to places where pastures were\navailable, large numbers of Maasai cattle died of starvation and disease\nin these years of drought. An enquiry in 1930 showed that the Maasai\nin Kenya possessed 720,000 cattle, 820,000 sheep and 171,000 donkeys.\nIn just two years of severe drought, 1933 and 1934, over half the\ncattle in the Maasai Reserve died.\nAs the area of grazing lands shrank, the adverse effect of the droughts\nincreased in intensity. The frequent bad years led to a steady decline\nof the animal stock of the pastoralists.\n3.4 Not All were Equally Affected\nIn Maasailand, as elsewhere in Africa, not all pastoralists were equally\naffected by the changes in the colonial period. In pre-colonial times\nMaasai society was divided into two social categories – elders and\nwarriors. The elders formed the ruling group and met in periodic\ncouncils to decide on the affairs of the community and settle disputes.\nThe warriors consisted of younger people, mainly responsible for\nthe protection of the tribe. They defended the community and\norganised cattle raids. Raiding was important in a society where cattle\nwas wealth. It is through raids that the power of different pastoral\ngroups was asserted. Young men came to be recognised as members\nof the warrior class when they proved their manliness by raiding\nthe cattle of other pastoral groups and participating in wars. They,\nhowever, were subject to the authority of the elders.\nFig.16 – Note how the warriors wear\ntraditional deep red shukas, brightly beaded\nMaasai jewelry and carry five-foot, steel tipped\nspears.

During the drought season, both\nwarriors and boys assume responsibility for\nherding livestock. Courtesy: The Massai Association.\nReprint 2025-26\nIndia and the Contemporary World\n114\nTo administer the affairs of the Maasai, the British introduced\na series of measures that had important implications. They\nappointed chiefs of different sub-groups of Maasai, who were\nmade responsible for the affairs of the tribe. The British\nimposed various restrictions on raiding and warfare.\nConsequently, the traditional authority of both elders and\nwarriors was adversely affected.\nThe chiefs appointed by the colonial government often\naccumulated wealth over time. They had a regular income with\nwhich they could buy animals, goods and land. They lent\nmoney to poor neighbours who needed cash to pay taxes. Many\nof them began living in towns, and became involved in trade.\nTheir wives and children stayed back in the villages to look\nafter the animals. These chiefs managed to survive the\ndevastations of war and drought. They had both pastoral and\nnon-pastoral income, and could buy animals when their stock\nwas depleted.\nBut the life history of the poor pastoralists who depended only\non their livestock was different.

Second, a new distinction between the wealthy and poor\npastoralists developed.\nConclusion\nSo we see that pastoral communities in different parts of the world\nare affected  in a variety of different ways by changes in the modern\nworld. New laws and new borders affect the patterns of their\nmovement. With increasing restrictions on their mobility,\npastoralists find it difficult to move in search of pastures. As pasture\nlands disappear grazing becomes a problem, while pastures that\nremain deteriorate through continuous over grazing. Times of\ndrought become times of crises, when cattle die in large numbers.\nYet, pastoralists do adapt to new times. They change the paths of\ntheir annual movement, reduce their cattle numbers, press for rights\nto enter new areas, exert political pressure on the government for\nrelief, subsidy and other forms of support and demand a right in\nthe management of forests and water resources. Pastoralists are not\nrelics of the past. They are not people who have no place in the\nmodern world. Environmentalists and economists have increasingly\ncome to recognise that pastoral nomadism is a form of life that is\nperfectly suited to many hilly and dry regions of the world.\nFig.18 – A Raika shepherd on Jaipur highway.\nHeavy traffic on highways has made migration of shepherds a new experience.\nReprint 2025-26\nIndia and the Contemporary World\n116\nQuestions\n?\nActivities\n1.

We\nwill look at how the lives of forest dwellers and pastoralists changed in the modern\nworld and how they played a part in shaping these changes.\nAll too often in looking at the emergence of the modern world, we only focus on\nfactories and cities, on the industrial and agricultural sectors which supply the market.\nBut we forget that there are other economies outside these sectors, other people too\nwho matter to the nation. To modern eyes, the lives of pastoralists and forest dwellers,\nthe shifting cultivators and food gatherers often seem to be stuck in the past. It is as\nif their lives are not important when we study the emergence of the contemporary\nworld. The chapters in Section II will suggest that we need to know about their\nlives, see how they organise their world and operate their economies. These\ncommunities are very much part of the modern world we live in today. They are\nnot simply survivors from a bygone era.\nChapter IV will take you into the forest and tell you about the variety of ways the\nforests were used by communities living within them. It will show how in the\nnineteenth century the growth of industries and urban centres,  ships and railways,\ncreated a new demand on the forests for timber and other forest products. New\ndemands led to new rules of forest use, new ways of organising the forest. You will\nsee how colonial control was established over the forests, how forest areas were\nmapped, trees were classified, and plantations were developed. All these developments\naffected the lives of those local communities who used forest resources. They were\nforced to operate within new systems and reorganise their lives. But they also rebelled\nagainst the rules and persuaded the state to change its policies. The chapter will give\nyou an idea of the history of such developments in India and Indonesia.\nSECTION II\nLIVELIHOODS, ECONOMIES AND SOCIETIES\nLIVELIHOODS, ECONOMIES AND SOCIETIES\nReprint 2025-26\nIndia and the Contemporary World\n76\nChapter V will track the movements of the pastoralists in the mountains and deserts,\nin the plains and plateaus of India and Africa. Pastoral communities in both these\nareas form an important segment of the population. Yet we rarely study their lives.\nTheir histories do not enter the pages of textbooks.  Chapter V will show how their\nlives were affected by the controls established over the forest, the expansion of agri-\nculture, and the decline of grazing fields. It will tell you about the patterns of their\nmovements, their relationships to other communities, and the way they adjust to\nchanging situations.\nWe cannot understand the making of the contemporary world unless we begin to see\nthe changes in the lives of diverse communities and people. We also cannot understand\nthe problems of modernisation unless we look at its impact on the environment.\nReprint 2025-26\n Forest Society and Colonialism\n77\nTake a quick look around your school and home and identify all\nthe things that come from forests: the paper in the book you are\nreading, desks and tables, doors and windows, the dyes that colour\nyour clothes, spices in your food, the cellophane wrapper of your\ntoffee, tendu leaf in bidis, gum, honey, coffee, tea and rubber. Do\nnot miss out the oil in chocolates, which comes from sal seeds, the\ntannin used to convert skins and hides into leather, or the herbs\nand roots used for medicinal purposes. Forests also provide bamboo,\nwood for fuel, grass, charcoal, packaging, fruits, flowers, animals,\nbirds and many other things. In the Amazon forests or in the\nWestern Ghats, it is possible to find as many as 500 different plant\nspecies in one forest patch.\nA lot of this diversity is fast disappearing. Between 1700 and 1995,\nthe period of industrialisation, 13.9 million sq km of forest or 9.3\nper cent of the world’s total area was cleared for industrial uses,\ncultivation, pastures and fuelwood.\nForest Society and Colonialism\nForest Society and\nForest Society and\nForest Society and\nForest Society and\nForest Society and\nColonialism\nColonialism\nColonialism\nColonialism\nColonialism\nFig.1 – A sal forest in Chhattisgarh.\nLook at the different heights of the trees and plants in this\npicture, and the variety of species. This is a dense forest,\nso very little sunlight falls on the forest floor.\nChapter IV\nReprint 2025-26\nIndia and the Contemporary World\n78\nThe disappearance of forests is referred to as deforestation.\nDeforestation is not a recent problem. The process began many\ncenturies ago; but under colonial rule it became more systematic and\nextensive.  Let us look at some of the causes of deforestation in India.\n1.1 Land to be Improved\nIn 1600, approximately one-sixth of India’s landmass was under\ncultivation. Now that figure has gone up to about half. As population\nincreased over the centuries and the demand for food went up,\npeasants extended the boundaries of cultivation, clearing forests and\nbreaking new land. In the colonial period, cultivation expanded\nrapidly for a variety of reasons. First, the British directly encouraged\n1  Why Deforestation?\nFig.2 – When the valleys were full. Painting by John Dawson.\nNative Americans like the Lakota tribe who lived in the Great North American Plains had a diversified economy. They\ncultivated maize, foraged for wild plants and hunted bison. Keeping vast areas open for the bison to range in was seen by\nthe English settlers as wasteful. After the 1860s the bisons were killed in large numbers.\nReprint 2025-26\n Forest Society and Colonialism\n79\nSource A\nThe idea that uncultivated land had to\nbe taken over and improved was popular\nwith colonisers everywhere in the world.\nIt was an argument that justified\nconquest.\nIn 1896 the American writer, Richard\nHarding, wrote on the Honduras in\nCentral America:\n‘There is no more interesting question of\nthe present day than that of what is to\nbe done with the world’s land which is\nlying unimproved; whether it shall go to\nthe great power that is willing to turn it\nto account, or remain with its original\nowner, who fails to understand its value.\nThe Central Americans are like a gang of\nsemi-barbarians in a beautifully furnished\nhouse, of which they can understand\nneither its possibilities of comfort nor its\nuse.’\nThree years later the American-owned\nUnited Fruit Company was founded, and\ngrew bananas on an industrial scale in\nCentral America.  The company acquired\nsuch power over the governments of\nthese countries that they came to be\nknown as Banana Republics.\nQuoted in David Spurr, The Rhetoric of\nEmpire, (1993).\nthe production of commercial crops like jute, sugar, wheat and\ncotton. The demand for these crops increased in nineteenth-century\nEurope where foodgrains were needed to feed the growing urban\npopulation and raw materials were required for industrial\nproduction. Second,  in the early nineteenth century, the colonial\nstate thought that forests were unproductive. They were considered\nto be wilderness that had to be brought under cultivation so that\nthe land could yield agricultural products and revenue, and enhance\nthe income of the state. So between 1880 and 1920, cultivated area\nrose by 6.7 million hectares.\nWe always see the expansion of cultivation as a sign of progress.\nBut we should not forget that for land to be brought under the\nplough, forests have to be cleared.\n1.2 Sleepers on the Tracks\nBox 1\nThe absence of cultivation in a place does not mean the land was\nuninhabited. In Australia, when the white settlers landed, they\nclaimed that the continent was empty or terra nullius. In fact, they\nwere guided through the landscape by aboriginal tracks, and led\nby aboriginal guides. The different aboriginal communities in\nAustralia had clearly demarcated territories. The Ngarrindjeri\npeople of Australia plotted their land along the symbolic body of\nthe first ancestor, Ngurunderi. This land included five different\nenvironments: salt water, riverine tracts, lakes, bush and desert\nplains, which satisfied different socio-economic needs.\nFig.3 – Converting sal logs into sleepers in the Singhbhum forests, Chhotanagpur, May 1897.\nAdivasis were hired by the forest department to cut trees, and make smooth planks which would serve as sleepers for the\nrailways. At the same time, they were not allowed to cut these trees to build their own houses.\nNew words\nSleepers – Wooden planks laid across railway\ntracks; they hold the tracks in position\nReprint 2025-26\nIndia and the Contemporary World\n80\nBy the early nineteenth century, oak forests in England were\ndisappearing. This created a problem of timber supply for the Royal\nNavy. How could English ships be built without a regular supply of\nstrong and durable timber? How could imperial power be protected\nand maintained without ships?  By the 1820s, search parties were\nsent to explore the forest resources of India.  Within a decade, trees\nwere being felled on a massive scale and vast quantities of timber\nwere being exported from India.\nThe spread of railways from the 1850s created a new demand.\nRailways were essential for colonial trade and for the movement of\nimperial troops. To run locomotives, wood was needed as fuel, and\nto lay railway lines sleepers were essential to hold the tracks together.\nEach mile of railway track required between 1,760 and 2,000 sleepers.\nFrom the 1860s, the railway network expanded rapidly. By 1890,\nabout 25,500 km of track had been laid. In 1946, the length of the\ntracks had increased to over 765,000 km.  As the railway tracks spread\nthrough India, a larger and larger number of trees were felled. As\nearly as the 1850s, in the Madras Presidency alone, 35,000 trees were\nbeing cut annually for sleepers. The government gave out contracts\nto individuals to supply the required quantities. These contractors\nbegan cutting trees indiscriminately. Forests around the railway tracks\nfast started disappearing.\nFig.5 – Elephants piling squares of timber at a timber yard in Rangoon.\nIn the colonial period elephants were frequently used to lift heavy timber both in the\nforests and at the timber yards.\nFig.4 – Bamboo rafts being floated down the\nKassalong river, Chittagong Hill Tracts.\nReprint 2025-26\n Forest Society and Colonialism\n81\nActivity\nSource B\n‘The new line to be constructed was the Indus Valley Railway\nbetween Multan and Sukkur, a distance of nearly 300 miles. At\nthe rate of 2000 sleepers per mile this would require 600,000\nsleepers 10 feet by 10 inches by 5 inches (or 3.5 cubic feet\napiece), being upwards of 2,000,000 cubic feet. The\nlocomotives would use wood fuel. At the rate of one train daily\neither way and at one maund per train-mile an annual supply\nof 219,000 maunds would be demanded. In addition a large\nsupply of fuel for brick-burning would be required. The sleepers\nwould have to come mainly from the Sind Forests. The fuel\nfrom the tamarisk and Jhand forests of Sind and the Punjab.\nThe other new line was the Northern State Railway from Lahore\nto Multan. It was estimated that 2,200,000 sleepers would be\nrequired for its construction.’\nE.P. Stebbing, The Forests of India, Vol. II (1923).\nEach mile of railway track required between\n1,760 and 2,000 sleepers. If one average-\nsized tree yields 3 to 5 sleepers for a 3 metre\nwide broad gauge track, calculate\napproximately how many trees would have to\nbe cut to lay one mile of track.\nFig.7 - Truck carrying logs\nWhen the forest department decided to take up\nan area for logging, one of the first things it did\nwas to build wide roads so that trucks could\nenter. Compare this to the forest tracks along\nwhich people walk to collect fuelwood and\nother minor forest produce. Many such trucks\nof wood go from forest areas to big cities.\nFig.6 - Women returning home after collecting\nfuelwood.\nReprint 2025-26\nIndia and the Contemporary World\n82\n1.3 Plantations\nLarge areas of natural forests were also cleared to make way for\ntea, coffee and rubber plantations to meet Europe’s growing need\nfor these commodities. The colonial government took over the\nforests, and gave vast areas to European planters at cheap rates.\nThese areas were enclosed and cleared of forests, and planted with\ntea or coffee.\nFig.8 – Pleasure Brand Tea.\nReprint 2025-26\n Forest Society and Colonialism\n83\nIn the previous section we have seen that the British needed forests\nin order to build ships and railways. The British were worried that\nthe use of forests by local people and the reckless felling of trees by\ntraders would destroy forests. So they decided to invite a German\nexpert, Dietrich Brandis, for advice, and made him the first Inspector\nGeneral of Forests in India.\nBrandis realised that a proper system had to be introduced to manage\nthe forests and people had to be trained in the science of conservation.\nThis system would need legal sanction. Rules about the use of forest\nresources had to be framed. Felling of trees and grazing had to be\nrestricted so that forests could be preserved for timber production.\nAnybody who cut trees without following the system had to be\n2  The Rise of Commercial Forestry\nFig.9 – One aisle of a managed poplar forest\nin Tuscany, Italy.\nPoplar forests are good mainly for timber.\nThey are not used for leaves, fruit or other\nproducts.

This is the model that\n‘scientific’ forestry has promoted.\nActivity\nIf you were the Government of India in 1862\nand responsible for supplying the railways\nwith sleepers and fuel on such a large scale,\nwhat were the steps you would have taken?\nReprint 2025-26\nIndia and the Contemporary World\n84\nNew words\nScientific forestry – A system of cutting\ntrees controlled by the forest department,\nin which old trees are cut and new ones\nplanted\npunished. So Brandis set up the Indian Forest Service in 1864 and\nhelped formulate the Indian Forest Act of 1865. The Imperial Forest\nResearch Institute was set up at Dehradun in 1906. The system they\ntaught here was called ‘scientific forestry’. Many people now,\nincluding ecologists, feel that this system is not scientific at all.\nIn scientific forestry, natural forests which had lots of different types\nof trees were cut down. In their place, one type of tree was planted\nin straight rows. This is called a plantation. Forest officials surveyed\nthe forests, estimated the area under different types of trees, and\nmade working plans for forest management. They planned how much\nof the  plantation area to cut every year. The area  cut was then to be\nreplanted so that it was ready to be cut again in some years.\nAfter the Forest Act was enacted in 1865, it was amended twice,\nonce in 1878 and then in 1927. The 1878 Act divided forests into\nthree categories: reserved, protected and village forests. The best\nforests were called ‘reserved forests’. Villagers could not take anything\nfrom these forests, even for their own use. For house building or\nfuel, they could take wood from protected or village forests.\n2.1 How were the Lives of People Affected?\nForesters and villagers had very different ideas of what a good forest\nshould look like. Villagers wanted forests with a mixture of species\nto satisfy different needs – fuel, fodder, leaves. The forest department\non the other hand wanted trees which were suitable for building\nFig.10 – A deodar plantation in Kangra, 1933.\nFrom Indian Forest Records, Vol. XV.\nFig.11 – The Imperial Forest School,\nDehra Dun, India.\nThe first forestry school to be inaugurated in\nthe British Empire.\nFrom: Indian Forester, Vol. XXXI\nReprint 2025-26\n Forest Society and Colonialism\n85\nships or railways. They  needed trees that could provide hard wood,\nand were tall and straight. So particular species like teak and sal were\npromoted and others were cut.\nIn forest areas, people use forest products – roots, leaves, fruits, and\ntubers – for many things. Fruits and tubers are nutritious to eat,\nespecially during the monsoons before the harvest has come in. Herbs\nare used for medicine, wood for agricultural implements like yokes\nand ploughs, bamboo makes excellent fences and is also used to make\nbaskets and umbrellas. A dried scooped-out gourd can be used as a\nportable water bottle. Almost everything is available in the forest –\nleaves can be stitched together to make  disposable plates and cups,\nthe siadi (Bauhinia vahlii) creeper can be used to make ropes, and the\nthorny bark of the semur (silk-cotton) tree is used to grate vegetables.\nOil for cooking and to light lamps can be pressed from the fruit of\nthe mahua tree.\nThe Forest Act meant severe hardship for villagers across the country.\nAfter the Act, all their everyday practices – cutting wood for their\nFig.12 – Collecting mahua ( Madhuca indica) from the forests.\nVillagers wake up before dawn and go to the forest to collect the mahua flowers which have fallen on the forest floor. Mahua\ntrees are precious. Mahua flowers can be eaten or used to make alcohol. The seeds can be used to make oil.\nFig.13 – Drying tendu leaves.\nThe sale of tendu leaves is a major source of\nincome for many people living in forests. Each\nbundle contains approximately 50 leaves, and if a\nperson works very hard they can perhaps collect\nas many as 100 bundles in a day. Women,\nchildren and old men are the main collectors.\nReprint 2025-26\nIndia and the Contemporary World\n86\nhouses, grazing their cattle, collecting fruits and roots, hunting and\nfishing  –  became illegal. People were now forced to steal wood\nfrom the forests, and if they were caught, they were at the mercy of\nthe forest guards who would take bribes from them. Women who\ncollected fuelwood were especially worried. It was also common for\npolice constables and forest guards to harass people by demanding\nfree food from them.\n2.2 How did Forest Rules Affect Cultivation?\nOne of the major impacts of European colonialism was on the practice\nof shifting cultivation or swidden agriculture. This is a  traditional\nagricultural practice in many parts of Asia, Africa and South America. It\nhas many local names such as lading in Southeast Asia, milpa in Central\nAmerica, chitemene or tavy  in Africa, and chena in Sri Lanka.  In\nIndia, dhya, penda, bewar, nevad, jhum, podu, khandad and  kumri\nare some of the local terms for swidden agriculture.\nIn shifting cultivation, parts of the forest are cut and burnt in rotation.\nSeeds are sown in the ashes after the first monsoon rains, and the crop is\nharvested by October-November. Such plots are cultivated for a couple\nof years and then left fallow for 12 to 18 years for the forest to grow\nback. A mixture of crops is grown on these plots. In central India\nand Africa it could be millets, in Brazil manioc, and in other parts of\nLatin America maize and beans.\nEuropean foresters regarded this practice as harmful for the forests. They\nfelt that land which was used for cultivation every few years could not\ngrow trees for railway timber. When a forest was burnt, there was\nthe added danger of the flames spreading and burning valuable timber.\nActivity\nChildren living around forest areas can often\nidentify hundreds of species of trees and plants.\nHow many species of trees can you name?\nFig.14 – Bringing grain from the threshing\ngrounds to the field.\nThe men are carrying grain in baskets from the\nthreshing fields. Men carry the baskets slung\non a pole across their shoulders, while women\ncarry the baskets on their heads.\nFig.15 – Taungya cultivation was a system in\nwhich local farmers were allowed to cultivate\ntemporarily within a plantation. In this photo\ntaken in Tharrawaddy division in Burma in\n1921 the cultivators are sowing paddy. The\nmen make holes in the soil using long bamboo\npoles with  iron tips. The women sow paddy\nin each hole.\nReprint 2025-26\n Forest Society and Colonialism\n87\nShifting cultivation also made it harder for the government to calculate\ntaxes. Therefore, the government decided to ban shifting cultivation.\nAs a result, many communities were forcibly displaced from their\nhomes in the forests. Some had to change occupations, while some\nresisted through large and small rebellions.\n2.3 Who could Hunt?\nThe new forest laws changed the lives of forest dwellers in yet another\nway. Before the forest laws, many people who lived in or near forests\nhad survived by hunting deer, partridges and a variety of small\nanimals. This customary practice was prohibited by the forest laws.\nThose who were caught hunting were now punished for poaching.\nWhile the forest laws deprived people of their customary rights to\nhunt, hunting of big game became a sport. In India, hunting of tigers\nand other animals had been part of the culture of the court and\nnobility for centuries. Many Mughal paintings show princes and\nemperors enjoying a hunt. But under colonial rule the scale of hunting\nincreased to such an extent that various species became almost extinct.\nThe British saw large animals as signs of a wild, primitive and savage\nsociety. They believed that by killing dangerous animals the British\nFig.17 – The little fisherman.\nChildren accompany their parents to the forest\nand learn early how to fish, collect forest\nproduce and cultivate. The bamboo trap which\nthe boy is holding in his right hand is kept at\nthe mouth of a stream – the fish flow into it.\nFig.16 – Burning the forest penda or podu plot.\nIn shifting cultivation, a clearing is made in the forest, usually on the slopes of hills.\nAfter the trees have been cut, they are burnt to provide ashes. The seeds are then\nscattered in the area, and left to be irrigated by the rain.\nReprint 2025-26\nIndia and the Contemporary World\n88\nwould civilise India. They gave rewards for the killing of tigers, wolves\nand other large animals on the grounds that they posed a threat to\ncultivators. 0ver 80,000 tigers, 150,000 leopards and 200,000 wolves\nwere killed for reward in the period 1875-1925. Gradually, the tiger\ncame to be seen as a sporting trophy. The Maharaja of Sarguja alone\nshot 1,157 tigers and 2,000 leopards up to 1957. A British\nadministrator, George Yule, killed 400 tigers. Initially certain areas\nof forests were reserved for hunting. Only much later did\nenvironmentalists and conservators begin to argue that all these species\nof animals needed to be protected, and not killed.\n2.4 New Trades, New Employments and New Services\nWhile people lost out in many ways after the forest department\ntook control of the forests, some people benefited from the new\nopportunities that had opened up in trade. Many communities left\ntheir traditional occupations and started trading in forest products.\nThis happened not only in India but across the world. For example,\nFig.18 – Lord Reading hunting in Nepal.\nCount the dead tigers in the photo. When British colonial officials and Rajas went hunting they were accompanied by a\nwhole retinue of servants. Usually, the tracking was done by skilled village hunters, and the Sahib simply fired the shot.\nSource C\nBaigas are a forest community of\nCentral India. In 1892, after their\nshifting cultivation was stopped, they\npetitioned to the government:\n‘We daily starve, having had no\nfoodgrain in our possession. The only\nwealth we possess is our axe.

From 1900-1912, the\nPutumayo output of 4000 tons of rubber\nwas associated with a decrease of some\n30,000 among the Indian population due\nto torture, disease and flight. A letter\nby an employee of a rubber company\ndescribes how the rubber was collected.\nThe manager summoned hundreds of\nIndians to the station:\nHe grasped his carbine and machete\nand began the slaughter of these\ndefenceless Indians, leaving the ground\ncovered with 150 corpses, among them,\nmen, women and children. Bathed in\nblood and appealing for mercy, the\nsurvivors were heaped with the dead\nand burned to death, while the manager\nshouted, “I want to exterminate all the\nIndians who do not obey my orders\nabout the rubber that I require them to\nbring in.” ’\nMichael Taussig, ‘Culture of Terror-Space\nof Death’, in Nicholas Dirks, ed.\nColonialism and Culture, 1992.\nwith the growing demand for rubber in the mid-nineteenth  century,\nthe Mundurucu peoples of the Brazilian Amazon who lived in villages\non high ground and cultivated manioc, began to collect latex from\nwild rubber trees for supplying  to traders. Gradually, they descended\nto live in trading posts and became completely dependent on traders.\nIn India, the trade in forest products was not new. From the medieval\nperiod onwards, we have records of adivasi communities trading\nelephants and other goods like hides, horns, silk cocoons, ivory,\nbamboo, spices, fibres, grasses, gums and resins through nomadic\ncommunities like the Banjaras.\nWith the coming of the British, however, trade was completely\nregulated by the government. The British government gave many\nlarge European trading firms the sole right to trade in the forest\nproducts of particular areas. Grazing and hunting by local people\nwere restricted. In the process, many pastoralist and nomadic\ncommunities like the Korava, Karacha and Yerukula of the Madras\nPresidency lost their livelihoods. Some of them began to be called\n‘criminal tribes’, and were forced to work instead in factories,\nmines and plantations, under government supervision.\nNew opportunities of work did not always mean improved well-\nbeing for the people. In Assam, both men and women from forest\ncommunities like Santhals and Oraons from Jharkhand, and\nGonds from Chhattisgarh were recruited to work on tea\nplantations. Their wages were low and conditions of work were\nvery bad. They could not return easily to their home villages\nfrom where they had been recruited.\nSource\nReprint 2025-26\nIndia and the Contemporary World\n90\nIn many parts of India, and across the world, forest communities\nrebelled against the changes that were being imposed on them. The\nleaders of these movements against the British like Siddhu and Kanu\nin the Santhal Parganas, Birsa Munda of Chhotanagpur or Alluri\nSitarama Raju of Andhra Pradesh are still remembered today in songs\nand stories.  We will now discuss in detail one such rebellion which\ntook place in the kingdom of Bastar in 1910.\n3.1 The People of Bastar\nBastar is located in the southernmost part of Chhattisgarh and\nborders Andhra Pradesh, Orissa and Maharashtra. The central part\nof Bastar is on a plateau. To the north of this plateau is the\nChhattisgarh plain and to its south is the Godavari plain. The river\nIndrawati winds across Bastar east to west. A number of different\ncommunities live in Bastar such as Maria and Muria Gonds, Dhurwas,\nBhatras and Halbas. They speak different languages but share\ncommon customs and beliefs.  The people of Bastar believe that each\nvillage was given its land by the Earth, and in return, they look after\n3  Rebellion in the Forest\nFig.19 – Army camp in Bastar, 1910.\nThis photograph of an army camp was taken in Bastar in 1910. The\narmy moved with tents, cooks and soldiers. Here a sepoy is guarding the\ncamp against rebels.\nFig.20 – Bastar in 2000.\nIn 1947 Bastar kingdom was merged with\nKanker kingdom and become Bastar district in\nMadhya Pradesh. In 1998 it was divided\nagain into three districts, Kanker, Bastar and\nDantewada. In 2001, these became part of\nChhattisgarh. The 1910 rebellion first started\nin the Kanger forest area (encircled) and soon\nspread to other parts of the state.\nSketch map\nNot to scale.\nReprint 2025-26\n Forest Society and Colonialism\n91\nSource E\nthe earth by making some offerings at each agricultural festival. In\naddition to the Earth, they show respect to the spirits of the river,\nthe forest and the mountain. Since each village knows where its\nboundaries lie, the local people look after all the natural resources\nwithin that boundary.  If people from a village want to take some\nwood from the forests of another village, they pay a small fee called\ndevsari, dand or man in exchange. Some villages also protect their forests\nby engaging watchmen and each household contributes some grain\nto pay them.  Every year there is one big hunt where the headmen of\nvillages in a pargana (cluster of villages) meet and discuss issues of\nconcern, including forests.\n3.2 The Fears of the People\nWhen the colonial government proposed to reserve two-thirds of\nthe forest in 1905, and stop shifting cultivation, hunting and collection\nof forest produce, the people of Bastar were very worried. Some\nvillages were allowed to stay on in the reserved forests on the condition\nthat they worked free for the forest department in cutting and\ntransporting trees, and protecting the forest from fires. Subsequently,\nthese came to be known as ‘forest villages’. People of other villages\nwere displaced without any notice or compensation. For long,\nvillagers had been suffering from increased land rents and frequent\ndemands for free labour and goods by colonial officials. Then came\nthe terrible famines, in 1899-1900 and again in 1907-1908.  Reservations\nproved to be the last straw.\nPeople began to gather and discuss these issues in their village councils,\nin bazaars and at festivals or wherever the headmen and priests of\nseveral villages were assembled. The initiative was taken by the\nDhurwas of the Kanger forest, where reservation first took place.\nAlthough there was no single leader, many people speak of  Gunda\nDhur, from  village Nethanar, as an important figure in the\nmovement. In 1910, mango boughs, a lump of earth, chillies and\narrows, began circulating between villages. These were actually\nmessages inviting villagers to rebel against the British. Every village\ncontributed something to the rebellion expenses. Bazaars were looted,\nthe houses of officials and traders, schools and police stations were\nburnt and robbed, and grain redistributed. Most of those who were\nattacked were in some way associated with the colonial state and its\noppressive laws. William Ward, a missionary who observed the events,\nwrote: ‘From all directions came streaming into Jagdalpur, police,\nmerchants, forest peons, schoolmasters and immigrants.’\n‘Bhondia collected 400 men, sacrificed a\nnumber of goats and started off to\nintercept the Dewan who was expected\nto return from the direction of Bijapur.\nThis mob started on the 10th February,\nburnt the Marenga school, the police\npost, lines and pound at Keslur and the\nschool at Tokapal (Rajur), detached a\ncontingent to burn Karanji school and\ncaptured a head constable and four\nconstables of the State reserve police\nwho had been sent out to escort the\nDewan and bring him in. The mob did\nnot maltreat the guard seriously but\neased them of their weapons and let\nthem go. One party of rebels under\nBhondia Majhi went off to the Koer river\nto block the passage there in case the\nDewan left the main road. The rest went\non to Dilmilli to stop the main road from\nBijapur. Buddhu Majhi and Harchand Naik\nled the main body.’\nLetter from DeBrett, Political Agent,\nChhattisgarh Feudatory States to\nCommissioner, Chhattisgarh Division, 23\nJune 1910.\nReprint 2025-26\nIndia and the Contemporary World\n92\nSource F\nElders living in Bastar recounted the story of this battle they had heard\nfrom their parents:\nPodiyami Ganga of Kankapal was told by his father Podiyami Tokeli that:\n‘The British came and started taking land. The Raja didn’t pay attention\nto things happening around him, so seeing that land was being taken,\nhis supporters gathered people. War started. His staunch supporters\ndied and the rest were whipped. My father, Podiyami Tokeli suffered many\nstrokes, but he escaped and survived. It was a movement to get rid of\nthe British. The British used to tie them to horses and pull them. From\nevery village two or three people went to Jagdalpur: Gargideva and\nMichkola of Chidpal, Dole and Adrabundi of Markamiras, Vadapandu of\nBaleras, Unga of Palem and many others.’\nSimilarly, Chendru, an elder from village Nandrasa, said:\n‘On the people’s side, were the big elders – Mille Mudaal of Palem, Soyekal\nDhurwa of Nandrasa, and Pandwa Majhi. People from every pargana\ncamped in Alnar tarai. The paltan (force) surrounded the people in a\nflash. Gunda Dhur had flying powers and flew away. But what could those\nwith bows and arrows do? The battle took place at night. The people hid\nin shrubs and crawled away. The army paltan also ran away. All those\nwho remained alive (of the people), somehow found their way home to\ntheir villages.’\nSource\nThe British sent troops to suppress the rebellion. The adivasi leaders\ntried to negotiate, but the British surrounded their camps and fired\nupon them. After that they marched through the villages flogging\nand punishing those who had taken part in the rebellion. Most\nvillages were deserted as people fled into the jungles. It took three\nmonths (February - May) for the British to regain control. However,\nthey never managed to capture Gunda Dhur. In a major victory\nfor the rebels, work on reservation was temporarily suspended,\nand the area to be reserved was reduced to roughly half of that\nplanned before 1910.\nThe story of the forests and people of Bastar does not end there.\nAfter Independence, the same practice of keeping people out of the\nforests and reserving them for industrial use continued. In the 1970s,\nthe World Bank proposed that 4,600 hectares of natural sal forest\nshould be replaced by tropical pine to provide pulp for the paper\nindustry. It was only after protests by local environmentalists that\nthe project was stopped.\nLet us now go to another part of Asia, Indonesia, and see what was\nhappening there over the same period.\nReprint 2025-26\n Forest Society and Colonialism\n93\nJava is now famous as a rice-producing island in Indonesia. But\nonce upon a time it was covered mostly with forests. The colonial\npower in Indonesia were the Dutch, and as we will see, there were\nmany similarities in the laws for forest control in Indonesia and\nIndia.  Java in Indonesia is where the Dutch started forest\nmanagement. Like the British, they wanted timber from Java to\nbuild ships. In 1600, the population of Java was an estimated 3.4\nmillion. There were many villages in the fertile plains, but there\nwere also many communities living in the mountains and practising\nshifting cultivation.\n4.1 The Woodcutters of Java\nThe Kalangs of Java were a community of skilled forest cutters and\nshifting cultivators. They were so valuable that in 1755 when the\nMataram kingdom of Java split, the 6,000 Kalang families were\nequally divided between the two kingdoms. Without their expertise,\nit would have been difficult to harvest teak and for the kings to\nbuild their palaces. When the Dutch began to gain control over the\nforests in the eighteenth century, they tried to make the Kalangs\nwork under them. In 1770, the Kalangs resisted by attacking a Dutch\nfort at Joana, but the uprising was suppressed.\n4.2 Dutch Scientific Forestry\nIn the nineteenth century, when it became\nimportant to control territory and not just\npeople, the Dutch enacted forest laws in Java,\nrestricting villagers’ access to forests. Now\nwood could only be cut for specified purposes\nlike making river boats or constructing houses,\nand only from specific forests under close\nsupervision. Villagers were punished for\ngrazing cattle in young stands, transporting\nwood without a permit, or travelling on forest\nroads with horse carts or cattle.\nAs in India, the need to manage forests for\nshipbuilding and railways led to the\n4  Forest Transformations in Java\nFig.21 – Train transporting teak out of the forest – late colonial period.\nReprint 2025-26\nIndia and the Contemporary World\n94\nSource G\nintroduction of a forest service. In 1882, 280,000 sleepers were\nexported from Java alone. However, all this required labour to cut\nthe trees, transport the logs and prepare the sleepers. The Dutch\nfirst imposed rents on land being cultivated in the forest and then\nexempted some villages from these rents if they worked collectively\nto provide free labour and buffaloes for cutting and transporting\ntimber.  This was known as the blandongdiensten system. Later, instead\nof rent exemption, forest villagers were given small wages, but their\nright to cultivate forest land was restricted.\n4.3 Samin’s Challenge\nAround 1890, Surontiko Samin of Randublatung village, a teak forest\nvillage, began questioning state ownership of the forest. He argued that\nthe state had not created the wind, water, earth and wood, so it could not\nown it. Soon a widespread movement developed. Amongst those who\nhelped organise it were Samin’s sons-in-law. By 1907, 3,000 families\nwere following his ideas.  Some of the Saminists protested by lying down\non their land when the Dutch came to survey it, while others refused to\npay taxes or fines or perform labour.\nDirk van Hogendorp, an official of the\nUnited East India Company in colonial\nJava said:\n‘Batavians! Be amazed! Hear with\nwonder what I have to communicate. Our\nfleets are destroyed, our trade\nlanguishes, our navigation is going to\nruin – we purchase with immense\ntreasures, timber and other materials\nfor ship-building from the northern\npowers, and on Java we leave warlike\nand mercantile squadrons with their\nroots in the ground. Yes, the forests of\nJava have timber enough to build a\nrespectable navy in a short time, besides\nas many merchant ships as we require\n… In spite of all (the cutting) the forests\nof Java grow as fast as they are cut,\nand would be inexhaustible under good\ncare and management.’\nDirk van Hogendorp, cited in Peluso, Rich\nForests, Poor People, 1992.\nFig.22 – Most of Indonesia’s forests are located in islands like Sumatra, Kalimantan and West Irian. However, Java is\nwhere the Dutch began their ‘scientific forestry’. The island, which is now famous for rice production, was once richly\ncovered with teak.\nReprint 2025-26\n Forest Society and Colonialism\n95\n4.4 War and Deforestation\nThe First World War and the Second World War had a major impact\non forests. In India, working plans were abandoned at this time, and\nthe forest department cut trees freely to meet British war needs. In\nJava, just before the Japanese occupied the region, the Dutch followed\n‘a scorched earth’ policy, destroying sawmills, and burning huge\npiles of giant teak logs so that they would not fall into Japanese\nhands. The Japanese then exploited the forests recklessly for their\nown war industries, forcing forest villagers to cut down forests.\nMany villagers used this opportunity to expand cultivation in the\nforest. After the war, it was difficult for the Indonesian forest service\nto get this land back. As in India, people’s need for agricultural land\nhas brought them into conflict with the forest department’s desire\nto control the land and exclude people from it.\n4.5 New Developments in Forestry\nSince the 1980s, governments across Asia and Africa have begun to\nsee that scientific forestry and the policy of keeping forest\ncommunities  away from forests has resulted in many conflicts.\nConservation of forests rather than collecting timber has become a\nmore important goal. The government has recognised that in order\nto meet this goal, the people who live near the forests must be\ninvolved. In many cases, across India, from Mizoram to Kerala, dense\nforests have survived only because villages protected them in sacred\ngroves known as sarnas, devarakudu, kan, rai, etc. Some villages have\nbeen patrolling their own forests, with each household taking it in\nturns, instead of leaving it to the forest guards. Local forest\ncommunities and environmentalists today are thinking of different\nforms of forest management.\nFig.23 – Indian Munitions Board, War Timber\nSleepers piled at Soolay pagoda ready for\nshipment,1917.\nThe Allies would not have been as successful\nin the First World War and the Second World\nWar if they had not been able to exploit the\nresources and people of their colonies. Both\nthe world wars had a devastating effect on the\nforests of India, Indonesia and elsewhere.\nThe forest department cut freely to satisfy war\nneeds.\nFig.24 – Log yard in Rembang under Dutch\ncolonial rule.\nReprint 2025-26\nIndia and the Contemporary World\n96\nActivities\nQuestions\n?\n1.

Horses\nwere yoked to chariots that were used in battles,\nwhich were fought to capture cattle. Battles were\nalso fought for land, which was important for\npasture, and for growing hardy crops that ripened\nquickly, such as barley.  Some battles were fought\nfor water, and to capture people.\nSome of the wealth that was obtained was kept\nby the leaders, some was given to the priests and\nthe rest was distributed amongst the people. Some\nwealth was used for the performance of yajnas or\nsacrifices in which offerings were made into the\nfire. These were meant for gods and goddesses.\nOfferings could include ghee, grain, and in some\ncases, animals.\nMost men took part in these wars. There was\nno regular army, but there were assemblies where\npeople met and discussed matters of war and\npeace. They also chose leaders, who were often\nbrave and skilful warriors.\nW\nW\nW\nW\nWor\nor\nor\nor\nords to describe people\nds to describe people\nds to describe people\nds to describe people\nds to describe people\nThere are several ways of describing people — in\nterms of the work they do, the language they\nspeak, the place they belong to, their family, their\ncommunities and cultural practices.

You will learn more about this\nin Chapter 5.\nSeveral vish or jana are mentioned by name.\nSo we find reference to the Puru jana or vish, the\nBharata jana or vish, the Yadu jana or vish, and\nso on.\nDo any of these names sound familiar?\nSometimes, the people who composed the\nhymns described themselves as Aryas and called\ntheir opponents Dasas or Dasyus. These were\npeople who did not perform sacrifices, and\nprobably spoke different languages. Later, the\nterm dasa (and the feminine dasi) came to mean\nslave. Slaves were women and men who were often\ncaptured in war. They were treated as the property\nof their owners, who could make them do\nwhatever work they wanted.\nWhile the Rigveda was being composed in the\nnorth-west of the subcontinent, there were other\ndevelopments elsewhere.

Stone tools found during this period are generally tiny, and are\ncalled microliths. Microliths were probably stuck on to handles of bone or\nwood to make tools such as saws and sickles. At the same time, older\nvarieties of tools continued to be in use.\nThe next stage, from about 10,000 years ago, is known as the Neolithic.\nWhat do you think the term Neolithic means?\nWe have also mentioned the names of some places. You will find the\nnames of many more places in later chapters. Very often, we use present-\nday names of the places where people lived in the past, because we do not\nknow what they called them.\nFROM HUNTING–GATHERING\nTO GROWING FOOD\n2020-21\n©  NCERT \nnot to be republished\n 16\nOUR PASTS–I\nA changing en\nA changing en\nA changing en\nA changing en\nA changing envir\nvir\nvir\nvir\nvironment\nonment\nonment\nonment\nonment\nAround 12,000 years ago, there were major\nchanges in the climate of the world, with a shift\nto relatively warm conditions. In many areas, this\nled to the development of grasslands. This in turn\nled to an increase in the number of deer, antelope,\ngoat, sheep and cattle, i.e. animals that survived\non grass.\nThose who hunted these animals now followed\nthem, learning about their food habits and their\nbreeding seasons. It is likely that this helped\npeople to start thinking about herding and rearing\nthese animals themselves.

This may have led them\nto think about growing plants on their own. In\nthis way people became farmers.\nPeople could also attract and then tame animals\nby leaving food for them near their shelters. The\nfirst animal to be tamed was the wild ancestor of\nthe dog. Later, people encouraged animals that\nwere relatively gentle to come near the camps\nwhere they lived. These animals such as sheep,\ngoat, cattle and also the pig lived in herds, and\nmost of them ate grass. Often, people protected\nthese animals from attacks by other wild animals.\nThis is how they became herders.\nCan you think of any reasons why the dog was\nperhaps the first animal to be tamed?\n2020-21\n©  NCERT \nnot to be republished\n17 \nDomestication\nDomestication\nDomestication\nDomestication\nDomestication\nis the name given to the process in which people grow plants and look\nafter animals. Very often, plants and animals that are tended by people\nbecome different from wild plants and animals. This is because people\nselect plants and animals for domestication. For example, they select\nthose plants and animals that are not prone to disease. They also select\nplants that yield large-size grain, and have strong stalks, capable of\nbearing the weight of the ripe grain.\nSeeds from selected plants are\npreserved and sown to ensure that\nnew plants (and seeds) will have the\nsame qualities.\nAmongst animals, those that are\nrelatively gentle are selected for\nbreeding. As a result, gradually,\ndomesticated animals and plants\nbecome different from wild animals\nand plants. For example, the teeth\nand horns of wild animals are usually much larger than those of\ndomesticated animals.\nLook at these two sets of teeth. Which do you think belongs to a wild\npig and which to a domesticated one?\nDomestication was a gradual process that took place in many parts\nof the world. It began about 12,000 years ago. Virtually all the plant and\nanimal produce that we use as food today is a result of domestication.\nSome of the earliest plants to be domesticated were wheat and barley.\nThe earliest domesticated animals include sheep and goat.\nA ne\nA ne\nA ne\nA ne\nA new w\nw w\nw w\nw w\nw waaaaay of lif\ny of lif\ny of lif\ny of lif\ny of lifeeeee\nIf you plant a seed, you will notice that it takes\nsome time to grow.

These may have provided shelter in cold\nweather. Archaeologists have also found cooking\nhearths both inside and outside the huts, which\nsuggests that, depending on the weather, people\ncould cook food either indoors or outdoors.\nDraw a pit house.\nStone tools have been found from many sites\nas well. Many of these are different from the earlier\nPalaeolithic tools and that is why they are called\nNeolithic. These include tools that were polished\nto give a fine cutting edge, and mortars and pestles\nused for grinding grain and other plant produce.\nMortars and pestles are used for grinding grain\neven today, several thousand years later. At the\nsame time, tools of the Palaeolithic types\ncontinued to be made and used, and remember,\nsome tools were also made of bone.\nNew stone tools.\nMany kinds of earthen pots have also been\nfound.

These include\nthe Samaveda, Yajurveda and Atharvaveda, as well as other books.\nThese were composed by priests, and described how rituals were to be\nperformed. They also contained rules about society.\nThere were several different groups in society at this time — priests\nand warriors, farmers, herders, traders, crafts persons, labourers, fishing\nfolk, and forest people. Some priests and warriors were rich, as were\nsome farmers and traders. Others, including many herders, crafts\npersons, labourers, fishing folk and hunters and gatherers, were poor.\nThe priests divided people into four groups, called varnas. According\nto them, each varna had a different set of functions.\nThe first varna was that of the brahmin. Brahmins were expected to\nstudy (and teach) the Vedas, perform sacrifices and receive gifts.\nIn the second place were the rulers, also known as kshatriyas. They\nwere expected to fight battles and protect people.\nThird were the vish or the vaishyas. They were expected to be farmers,\nherders, and traders. Both the kshatriyas and the vaishyas could\nperform sacrifices.\n2020-21\n©  NCERT \nnot to be republished\n 48\nOUR PASTS–I\nPainted Grey Ware.\nPlates and bowls are the\nmost common vessels\nmade out of Painted\nGrey Ware.

The word janapada literally means\nthe land where the jana set its foot, and settled\ndown. Some important janapadas are shown on\nMap 4 (page 49).\nArchaeologists have excavated a number of\nsettlements in these janapadas, such as Purana\nQila in Delhi, Hastinapura near Meerut,\nand Atranjikhera, near Etah (the last two\nare in Uttar Pradesh). They found that\npeople lived in huts, and kept cattle as well\nas other animals. They also grew a variety\nof crops — rice, wheat, barley, pulses,\nsugarcane, sesame and mustard.\nIs there a crop in this list that was not\nmentioned in Chapter 3?\nLast were the shudras, who had to serve the other three groups and\ncould not perform any rituals. Often, women were also grouped with the\nshudras. Both women and shudras were not allowed to study the Vedas.\nThe priests also said that these groups were decided on the basis of\nbirth. For example, if one’s father and mother were brahmins one would\nautomatically become a brahmin, and so on. Later, they classified some\npeople as untouchable. These included some crafts persons, hunters\nand gatherers, as well as people who helped perform burials and\ncremations. The priests said that contact with these groups was polluting.\nMany people did not accept the system of varna laid down by the\nbrahmins. Some kings thought they were superior to the priests. Others\nfelt that birth could not be a basis for deciding which varna people\nbelonged to. Besides, some people felt that there should be no differences\namongst people based on occupation. Others felt that everybody should\nbe able to perform rituals. And others condemned the practice of\nuntouchability. Also, there were many areas in the subcontinent, such\nas the north-east, where social and economic differences were not very\nsharp, and where the influence of the priests was limited.\nWhy did people oppose the system of varnas?\n2020-21\n©  NCERT \nnot to be republished\n49 \nThey made earthen pots.

Also in this way, the land and\nthe people living inside the fortified area could be\ncontrolled more easily by the king. Building such\nhuge walls required a great deal of planning.\nThousands, if not lakhs of bricks or stones had\nto be prepared.

One was the growing use of\niron ploughshares. This meant that heavy, clayey\nsoil could be turned over better than with a\nwooden ploughshare, so that more grain could\nbe produced. Second, people began transplanting\npaddy. This meant that instead of scattering seed\non the ground, from which plants would sprout,\nsaplings were grown and then planted in the\nfields. This led to increased production, as many\nmore plants survived. However, it was back\nbreaking work.

Elephants, which lived in the forest,\ncould be captured and trained for the army.\nForests also provided wood for building houses,\ncarts and chariots. Besides, there were iron ore\nmines in the region that could be tapped to make\nstrong tools and weapons.\nMagadha had two very powerful rulers,\nBimbisara and Ajatasattu, who used all possible\nmeans to conquer other janapadas. Mahapadma\nNanda was another important ruler. He extended\nhis control up to the north-west part of the\nsubcontinent.

This is caused because we have\ncravings and desires (which often cannot be\nfulfilled). Sometimes, even if we get what we want,\nwe are not satisfied, and want even more (or want\nother things). The Buddha described this as thirst\nor tanha. He taught that this constant craving\ncould be removed by following moderation in\neverything.\nHe also taught people to be kind, and to\nrespect the lives of others, including animals. He\nbelieved that the results of our actions (called\nkarma), whether good or bad,\naffect us both in this life and\nthe next.

For twelve years\nhe led a hard and lonely life, at the end of which\nhe attained enlightenment.\nHe taught a simple doctrine: men and women\nwho wished to know the truth must leave their\nhomes. They must follow very strictly the  rules of\nahimsa, which means not hurting or killing living\nbeings. “All beings,” said Mahavira “long to live.\nTo all things life is dear.” Ordinary people could\nunderstand the teachings of Mahavira and his\nfollowers, because they used Prakrit. There were\nseveral forms of Prakrit, used in different parts of\nthe country, and named after the regions in which\nthey were used. For example, the Prakrit spoken\nin Magadha was known as Magadhi.\nFollowers of Mahavira, who were known as\nJainas, had to lead very simple lives, begging for\nfood.

Of these\nsix cities, two were very important: Puhar or\nKaveripattinam, the port of the Cholas, and\nMadurai, the capital of the Pandyas.\nThe chiefs did not collect regular taxes. Instead,\nthey demanded and received gifts from the people.\nThey also went on military expeditions, and\ncollected tribute from neighbouring areas.

About 2000\nyears ago, wearing silk became the fashion\namongst rulers and rich people in Rome. It was\nvery expensive, as it had to be brought all the\nway from China, along dangerous roads, through\nmountains and deserts. People living along the\nroute often demanded payments for allowing\ntraders to pass through.\nLook at Map 6 (pages 76-77) which shows the\nSilk Route and its branches. Some kings tried to\ncontrol large portions of the route. This was\nbecause they could benefit from taxes, tributes\nand gifts that were brought by traders travelling\nalong the route. In return, they often protected\nthe traders who passed through their kingdoms\nfrom attacks by robbers.\nThe best-known of the rulers who controlled\nthe Silk Route were the Kushanas, who ruled over\ncentral Asia and north-west India around 2000\nyears ago. Their two major centres of power were\nPeshawar and Mathura. Taxila was also included\nin their kingdom. During their rule, a branch of\nthe Silk Route extended from Central Asia down\nto the seaports at the mouth of the river Indus,\nfrom where silk was shipped westwards to the\nRoman Empire.

These deities\nincluded Shiva, Vishnu, and goddesses such as\nDurga.\nThese deities were worshipped through Bhakti,\nan idea that became very popular at this time.\nBhakti is generally understood as a person’s\ndevotion to his or her chosen deity. Anybody,\nwhether rich or poor, belonging to the so-called\n‘high’ or ‘low’ castes, man or woman, could follow\nthe path of Bhakti.\nThe idea of Bhakti is present in the Bhagavad\nGita, a sacred book of the Hindus, which is\nincluded in the Mahabharata (see Chapter\n11). In this Krishna the God, asks Arjuna,\nhis devotee and friend, to abandon all\ndharmas and take refuge in him, as only\nhe can set Arjuna free from every evil.\nThis form of worship gradually spread\nto different parts of the country.\nThose who followed the system of\nBhakti emphasised devotion and\nindividual worship of a god or goddess,\nrather than the performance of\nelaborate sacrifices.\nAccording to this system of belief, if\na devotee worships the chosen deity\nwith a pure heart, the deity will appear\nin the form in which he or she may\ndesire. So, the deity could be thought\nof as a human being, lion, tree or any\nother form. Once this idea gained\nacceptance, artists made beautiful\nimages of these deities.\nVishnu as Varaha — an\nimage from Eran,\nMadhya Pradesh.\nThis magnificent statue is\nof a special form of\nVishnu, the Varaha or\nboar.

This\ngives us the genealogy of Harsha, and ends with\nhis becoming king.

His brother-in-law was\nthe ruler of Kanauj (see Map 7) and he was killed\nby the ruler of Bengal. Harsha took over the\nkingdom of Kanauj, and then led an army against\nthe ruler of Bengal.\nAlthough he was successful in the east, and\nconquered Magadha and probably Bengal also,\nhe was not as successful elsewhere.

It developed\nas a religious centre, with a number of temples.\nThe Pallavas and Chalukyas frequently raided one\nanother’s lands, especially attacking the capital\ncities, which were prosperous towns.\nThe best-known Chalukya ruler was Pulakeshin\nII.

Besides, he\nchecked the advance of Harsha. There is an\ninteresting play of words in the poem. Harsha\nmeans happiness. The poet says that after this\ndefeat, Harsha was no longer Harsha! Pulakeshin\nalso attacked the Pallava king, who took shelter\nbehind the walls of Kanchipuram.\nBut the Chalukya victory was short-lived.\nUltimately, both the Pallavas and the Chalukyas\ngave way to new rulers belonging to the\nRashtrakuta and Chola dynasties, about which\nyou will study in Class VII.\nWho were the other rulers who tried to control\nthe coasts and why?

For instance:\n•\nSome important administrative posts were now\nhereditary. This means that sons succeeded fathers\nto these posts. For example, the poet Harishena was\na maha-danda-nayaka, or chief judicial officer, like\nhis father.\n•\nSometimes, one person held many offices. For\ninstance, besides being a maha-danda-nayaka,\nHarishena was a kumar-amatya, meaning an\nimportant minister, and a sandhi-vigrahika,\nmeaning a minister of war and peace.\n•\nBesides, important men probably had a say in local\nadministration.

Besides, there were\nmilitary leaders who provided the king with troops\nwhenever he needed them. They were not paid\nregular salaries. Instead, some of them received\ngrants of land. They collected revenue from the\nland and used this to maintain soldiers and\nhorses, and provide equipment for warfare. These\nmen were known as samantas.

But as you will\nsee in this chapter, the making of the global world has a long\nhistory – of trade, of migration, of people in search of work, the\nmovement of capital, and much else. As we think about the dramatic\nand visible signs of global interconnectedness in our lives today,\nwe need to understand the phases through which this world in\nwhich we live has emerged.\nAll through history, human societies have become steadily more\ninterlinked. From ancient times, travellers, traders, priests and\npilgrims travelled vast distances for knowledge, opportunity and\nspiritual fulfilment, or to escape persecution. They carried goods,\nmoney, values, skills, ideas, inventions, and even germs and diseases.\nAs early as 3000 BCE an active coastal trade linked the Indus valley\ncivilisations with present-day West Asia. For more than a millennia,\ncowries (the Hindi cowdi or seashells, used as a form of currency)\nfrom the Maldives found their way to China and East Africa. The\nlong-distance spread of disease-carrying germs may be traced as\nfar back as the seventh century. By the thirteenth century it had\nbecome an unmistakable link.\nThe Making of a Global World\nChapter III\nThe Making of a Global World\nFig. 1 – Image of a ship on a memorial stone,\nGoa Museum, tenth century CE.\nFrom the ninth century, images of ships\nappear regularly in memorial stones found in\nthe western coast, indicating the significance\nof oceanic trade.\nReprint 2025-26\nIndia and the Contemporary World\n54\n1.1 Silk Routes Link the World\nThe silk routes are a good example of vibrant pre-modern trade\nand cultural links between distant parts of the world. The name ‘silk\nroutes’ points to the importance of West-bound Chinese silk cargoes\nalong this route. Historians have identified several silk routes, over\nland and by sea, knitting together vast regions of Asia, and linking\nAsia with Europe and northern Africa. They are known to have\nexisted since before the Christian Era and thrived almost till the\nfifteenth century. But Chinese pottery also travelled the same route,\nas did textiles and spices from India and Southeast Asia. In return,\nprecious metals – gold and silver – flowed from Europe to Asia.\nTrade and cultural exchange always went hand in hand. Early\nChristian missionaries almost certainly travelled this route to Asia, as\ndid early Muslim preachers a few centuries later. Much before all\nthis, Buddhism emerged from eastern India and spread in several\ndirections through intersecting points on the silk routes.\n1.2 Food Travels: Spaghetti and Potato\nFood offers many examples of long-distance cultural exchange.\nTraders and travellers introduced new crops to the lands they\ntravelled. Even ‘ready’ foodstuff  in distant parts of the world might\nshare common origins. Take spaghetti and noodles. It is believed\nthat noodles travelled west from China to\nbecome spaghetti. Or, perhaps Arab traders\ntook pasta to fifth-century Sicily, an island now\nin Italy. Similar foods were also known in India\nand Japan, so the truth about their origins may\nnever be known. Yet such guesswork suggests\nthe possibilities of long-distance cultural contact\neven in the pre-modern world.\nMany of our common foods such as potatoes,\nsoya, groundnuts, maize, tomatoes, chillies,\nsweet potatoes, and so on were not known to\nour ancestors until about five centuries ago.\nThese foods were only introduced in Europe\nand Asia after Christopher Columbus\naccidentally discovered the vast continent that\nwould later become known as the Americas.\nFig. 3 – Merchants from Venice and the Orient exchanging goods,\nfrom Marco Polo, Book of Marvels, fifteenth century.\nFig. 2 – Silk route trade as depicted in a\nChinese cave painting, eighth century, Cave\n217, Mogao Grottoes, Gansu, China.\nReprint 2025-26\n55\nThe  Making  of  a  Global  World\n(Here we will use ‘America’ to describe North America, South\nAmerica and the Caribbean.) In fact, many of our common foods\ncame from America’s original inhabitants – the American Indians.\nSometimes the new crops could make the difference between life\nand death. Europe’s poor began to eat better and live longer with\nthe introduction of the humble potato. Ireland’s poorest peasants\nbecame so dependent on potatoes that when disease destroyed the\npotato crop in the mid-1840s, hundreds of thousands died\nof starvation.\n1.3 Conquest, Disease and Trade\nThe pre-modern world shrank greatly in the sixteenth century after\nEuropean sailors found a sea route to Asia and also successfully\ncrossed the western ocean to America. For centuries before, the\nIndian Ocean had known a bustling trade, with goods, people,\nknowledge, customs, etc. criss-crossing its waters. The Indian\nsubcontinent was central to these flows and a crucial point in their\nnetworks.  The entry of the Europeans helped expand or redirect\nsome of these flows towards Europe.\nBefore its ‘discovery’, America had been cut off from regular contact\nwith the rest of the world for millions of years. But from the sixteenth\ncentury, its vast lands and abundant crops and minerals began to\ntransform trade and lives everywhere.\nPrecious metals, particularly silver, from mines located in present-\nday Peru and Mexico also enhanced Europe’s wealth and financed\nits trade with Asia. Legends spread in seventeenth-century Europe\nabout South America’s fabled wealth. Many expeditions set off in\nsearch of El Dorado, the fabled city of gold.\nThe Portuguese and Spanish conquest and colonisation of America\nwas decisively under way by the mid-sixteenth century.  European\nconquest was not just a result of superior firepower. In fact, the\nmost powerful weapon of the Spanish conquerors was not a\nconventional military weapon at all. It was the germs such as those\nof smallpox that they carried on their person. Because of their long\nisolation, America’s original inhabitants had no immunity against\nthese diseases that came from Europe. Smallpox in particular proved\na deadly killer. Once introduced, it spread deep into the continent,\nahead even of any Europeans reaching there. It killed and decimated\nwhole communities, paving the way for conquest.\nFig. 4 –  The Irish Potato Famine, Illustrated\nLondon News, 1849.\nHungry children digging for potatoes in a field that\nhas already been harvested, hoping to discover\nsome leftovers. During the Great Irish Potato\nFamine (1845 to 1849), around 1,000,000\npeople died of starvation in Ireland, and double the\nnumber emigrated in search of work.\n‘Biological’ warfare?\nJohn Winthorp, the first governor of  the\nMassachusetts Bay colony in New England,\nwrote in May 1634 that smallpox signalled God’s\nblessing for the colonists: ‘… the natives … were\nneere (near) all dead of small Poxe (pox), so as\nthe Lord hathe (had) cleared our title to what\nwe possess’.\nAlfred Crosby, Ecological Imperialism.\nBox 1\nReprint 2025-26\nIndia and the Contemporary World\n56\nExplain what we mean when we say that the\nworld ‘shrank’ in the 1500s.\nDiscuss\nGuns could be bought or captured and turned against the invaders.\nBut not diseases such as smallpox to which the conquerors were\nmostly immune.\nUntil the nineteenth century, poverty and hunger were common in\nEurope. Cities were crowded and deadly diseases were widespread.\nReligious conflicts were common, and religious dissenters were\npersecuted. Thousands therefore fled Europe for America. Here,\nby the eighteenth century, plantations worked by slaves captured\nin Africa were growing cotton and sugar for European markets.\nUntil well into the eighteenth century, China and India were among\nthe world’s richest countries. They were also pre-eminent in Asian\ntrade. However, from the fifteenth century, China is said to have\nrestricted overseas contacts and retreated into isolation.  China’s\nreduced role and the rising importance of the Americas gradually\nmoved the centre of world trade westwards. Europe now emerged\nas the centre of  world trade.\nNew words\nDissenter – One who refuses to accept\nestablished beliefs and practices\nFig. 5 – Slaves for sale, New Orleans, Illustrated London News, 1851.\nA prospective buyer carefully inspecting slaves lined up before the auction.

To attract\nbuyers, slaves were often dressed in their best clothes.\nReprint 2025-26\n57\nThe  Making  of  a  Global  World\nThe world changed profoundly in the nineteenth century. Economic,\npolitical, social, cultural and technological factors interacted in\ncomplex ways to transform societies and reshape external relations.\nEconomists identify three types of movement or ‘flows’ within\ninternational economic exchanges. The first is the flow of trade which\nin the nineteenth century referred largely to trade in goods (e.g.,\ncloth or wheat). The second is the flow of labour – the migration\nof people in search of employment. The third is the movement of\ncapital for short-term or long-term investments over long distances.\nAll three flows were closely interwoven and affected peoples’ lives\nmore deeply now than ever before. The interconnections could\nsometimes be broken – for example, labour migration was often\nmore restricted than goods or capital flows. Yet it helps us understand\nthe nineteenth-century world economy better if we look at the\nthree flows together.\n2.1 A World Economy Takes Shape\nA good place to start is the changing pattern of food production\nand consumption in industrial Europe. Traditionally, countries liked\nto be self-sufficient in food. But in nineteenth-century Britain,\nself-sufficiency in food meant lower living standards and social\nconflict. Why was this so?\nPopulation growth from the late eighteenth century had increased\nthe demand for food grains in Britain. As urban centres expanded\nand industry grew, the demand for agricultural products went\nup, pushing up food grain prices. Under pressure from landed\ngroups, the government also restricted the import of corn. The\nlaws allowing the government to do this were commonly known as\nthe ‘Corn Laws’. Unhappy with high food prices, industrialists and\nurban dwellers forced the abolition of the Corn Laws.\nAfter the Corn Laws were scrapped, food could be imported into\nBritain more cheaply than it could be produced within the country.\nBritish agriculture was unable to compete with imports.  Vast areas\nof land were now left uncultivated, and thousands of men and\nwomen were thrown out of work. They flocked to the cities or\nmigrated overseas.\n2  The Nineteenth Century (1815-1914)\nReprint 2025-26\nIndia and the Contemporary World\n58\nAs food prices fell, consumption in Britain rose. From the mid-\nnineteenth century, faster industrial growth in Britain also led to higher\nincomes, and therefore more food imports. Around the world – in\nEastern Europe, Russia, America and Australia  –  lands were cleared\nand food production expanded to meet the British demand.\nIt was not enough merely to clear lands for agriculture. Railways\nwere needed to link the agricultural regions to the ports. New\nharbours had to be built and old ones expanded to ship the new\ncargoes. People had to settle on the lands to bring them under\ncultivation. This meant building homes and settlements. All these\nactivities in turn required capital and labour. Capital flowed from\nfinancial centres such as London. The demand for labour in places\nwhere labour was in short supply – as in America and Australia –\nled to more migration.\nNearly 50 million people emigrated from Europe to America and\nAustralia in the nineteenth century. All over the world some 150\nmillion are estimated to have left their homes, crossed oceans and\nvast distances over land in search of a better future.\nFig. 6 – Emigrant ship leaving for the US, by\nM.W. Ridley, 1869.\nFig. 7 – Irish emigrants waiting to board the ship, by  Michael Fitzgerald, 1874.\nReprint 2025-26\n59\nThe  Making  of  a  Global  World\nPrepare a flow chart to show how Britain’s\ndecision to import food led to increased\nmigration to America and Australia.\nActivity\nThus by 1890, a global agricultural economy had taken shape,\naccompanied by complex changes in labour movement patterns,\ncapital flows, ecologies and technology. Food no longer came from\na nearby village or town, but from thousands of miles away. It was\nnot grown by a peasant tilling his own land, but by an agricultural\nworker, perhaps recently arrived, who was now working on a large\nfarm that only a generation ago had most likely been a forest. It was\ntransported by railway, built for that very purpose, and by ships\nwhich were increasingly manned in these decades by low-paid\nworkers from southern Europe, Asia, Africa and the Caribbean.\nImagine that you are an agricultural worker who has arrived in\nAmerica from Ireland. Write a paragraph on why you chose to\ncome and how you are earning your living.\nActivity\nSome of this dramatic change, though on a smaller scale, occurred\ncloser home in west Punjab. Here the British Indian government\nbuilt a network of irrigation canals to transform semi-desert wastes\ninto fertile agricultural lands that could grow wheat and cotton for\nexport. The Canal Colonies, as the areas irrigated by the new canals\nwere called, were settled by peasants from other parts of Punjab.\nOf course, food is merely an example. A similar story can be told\nfor cotton, the cultivation of which expanded worldwide to feed\nBritish textile mills. Or rubber. Indeed, so rapidly did regional\nspecialisation in the production of commodities develop, that\nbetween 1820 and 1914 world trade is estimated to have multiplied\n25 to 40 times. Nearly 60 per cent of this trade comprised ‘primary\nproducts’ – that is, agricultural products such as wheat and cotton,\nand minerals such as coal.\n2.2 Role of Technology\nWhat was the role of technology in all this? The railways, steamships,\nthe telegraph, for example, were important inventions without\nwhich we cannot imagine the transformed nineteenth-century world.\nBut technological advances were often the result of larger social,\npolitical and economic factors. For example, colonisation stimulated\nnew investments and improvements in transport: faster railways,\nlighter wagons and larger ships helped move food more cheaply\nand quickly from faraway farms to final markets.\nReprint 2025-26\nIndia and the Contemporary World\n60\nThe trade in meat offers a good example of this connected process.\nTill the 1870s, animals were shipped live from America to Europe\nand then slaughtered when they arrived there. But live animals took\nup a lot of ship space. Many also died in voyage, fell ill, lost weight,\nor became unfit to eat. Meat was hence an expensive luxury beyond\nthe reach of the European poor. High prices in turn kept demand\nand production down until the development of a new technology,\nnamely, refrigerated ships, which enabled the transport of perishable\nfoods over long distances.\nNow animals were slaughtered for food at the starting point – in\nAmerica, Australia or New Zealand – and then transported to\nEurope as frozen meat. This reduced shipping costs and lowered\nmeat prices in Europe. The poor in Europe could now consume\na more varied diet. To the earlier monotony of bread and potatoes\nmany, though not all, could now add meat (and butter and eggs)\nto their diet. Better living conditions promoted social peace within\nthe country and support for imperialism abroad.\n2.3 Late nineteenth-century Colonialism\nTrade flourished and markets expanded in the late nineteenth\ncentury. But this was not only a period of expanding trade and\nincreased prosperity. It is important to realise that there was a\ndarker side to this process.  In many parts of the world, the\nexpansion of trade and a closer relationship with the world\neconomy also meant a loss of freedoms and livelihoods. Late-\nnineteenth-century European conquests produced many painful\neconomic, social and ecological changes through which the\ncolonised societies were brought into the world economy.\nFig. 8 — The Smithfield Club\nCattle Show, Illustrated London\nNews, 1851.\nCattle were traded at fairs, brought\nby farmers for sale. One of the\noldest livestock markets in London\nwas at Smithfield. In the mid-\nnineteenth century a huge poultry\nand meat market was established\nnear the railway line connecting\nSmithfield to all the meat-supplying\ncentres of the country.\nFig. 9 – Meat being loaded on to the ship,\nAlexandra, Illustrated London News, 1878.\nExport of meat was possible only after ships\nwere refrigerated.\nReprint 2025-26\n61\nThe  Making  of  a  Global  World\nLook at a map of Africa (Fig. 10). You\nwill see some countries’ borders run\nstraight, as if they were drawn using a\nruler. Well, in fact this was almost how\nrival European powers in Africa drew up\nthe borders demarcating their respective\nterritories. In 1885 the big European\npowers met in Berlin to complete the\ncarving up of Africa between them.\nBritain and France made vast additions to\ntheir overseas territories in the late nineteenth\ncentury. Belgium and Germany became new\ncolonial powers. The US also became a\ncolonial power in the late 1890s by taking\nover some colonies earlier held by Spain.\nLet us look at one example of the destructive\nimpact of colonialism on the economy and\nlivelihoods of colonised people.\nSir Henry Morton Stanley in Central\nAfrica\nStanley was a journalist and explorer sent\nby the New York Herald to find Livingston,\na missionary and explorer who had been in\nAfrica for several years. Like other European\nand American explorers of the time, Stanley\nwent with arms, mobilised local hunters,\nwarriors and labourers to help him, fought\nwith local tribes, investigated African\nterrains, and mapped different regions.\nThese explorations helped the conquest\nof Africa. Geographical explorations were\nnot driven by an innocent search for\nscientific information. They were directly\nlinked to imperial projects.\nBox 2\nFig. 10 – Map of colonial Africa at the end of the nineteenth century.\nFig. 11 – Sir Henry Morton Stanley and his retinue in Central Africa,\nIllustrated London News, 1871.\nMOROCCO\nALGERIA\nSPANISH\nSAHARA\nRIO\nDE ORO\nPORT\nGUINEA\nFRENCH SUDAN\nFRENCH WEST AFRICA\nNIGERIA\nTOGO\nCAMEROONS\nMIDDLE\nCONGO\nCONGO\nFREE STATE\n(BELGIAN\nCONGO)\nANGOLA\nGERMAN\nSOUTH WEST\nAFRICA\nUNION OF\nSOUTH AFRICA\nNORTHERN\nRHODESIA\nSOUTHERN\nRHODESIA\nPORTUGUESE\nEAST AFRICA\nMADAGASCAR\nGERMAN\nEAST AFRICA\nBRITISH\nEAST AFRICA\nBRITISH\nSOMALILAND\nETHIOPIA\nITALIAN\nSOMALILAND\nFRENCH\nSOMALILAND\nERITREA\nANGLO-\nEGYPTIAN\nSUDAN\nEGYPT\nLIBYA\n(TRIPOLI)\nTUNISIA MEDITERRANEAN SEA\nFRENCH\nEQUATORIAL\nAFRICA\nSPANISH\nMOROCCO\nRED SEA\nATLANTIC\nOCEAN\nBELGIAN\nBRITISH\nFRENCH\nGERMAN\nITALIAN\nPORTUGUESE\nSPANISH\nBRITISH DOMINION\nINDEPENDENT STATE\nGOLD\nCOAST\nIVORY\nCOAST\nSIERRA\nLEONE\nReprint 2025-26\nIndia and the Contemporary World\n62\n2.4 Rinderpest, or the Cattle Plague\nIn Africa, in the 1890s, a fast-spreading disease of cattle plague\nor Rinderpest had a terrifying impact on people’s\nlivelihoods and the local economy. This is a good example\nof the widespread European imperial impact on colonised\nsocieties. It shows how in this era of conquest even a disease\naffecting cattle reshaped the lives and fortunes of thousands\nof people and their relations with the rest of the world.\nHistorically, Africa had abundant land and a relatively small\npopulation. For centuries, land and livestock sustained African\nlivelihoods and people rarely worked for a wage. In late-\nnineteenth-century Africa there were few consumer goods that\nwages could buy. If you had been an African possessing land\nand livestock – and there was plenty of both – you too would\nhave seen little reason to work for a wage.\nIn the late nineteenth century, Europeans were attracted to\nAfrica due to its vast resources of land and minerals. Europeans\ncame to Africa hoping to establish plantations and mines to\nproduce crops and minerals for export to Europe. But there\nwas an unexpected problem – a shortage of labour willing to\nwork for wages.\nEmployers used many methods to recruit and retain labour. Heavy\ntaxes were imposed which could be paid only by working for wages\non plantations and mines. Inheritance laws were changed so that\nFig. 12 – Transport to the Transvaal gold mines,\nThe Graphic, 1887.\nCrossing the Wilge river was the quickest method of\ntransport to the gold fields of Transvaal. After the\ndiscovery of gold in Witwatersrand, Europeans\nrushed to the region despite their fear of disease and\ndeath, and the difficulties of the journey. By the\n1890s, South Africa contributed over 20 per cent of\nthe world gold production.\nFig. 13 — Diggers at work\nin the Transvaal gold fields\nin South Africa, The\nGraphic, 1875.\nReprint 2025-26\n63\nThe  Making  of  a  Global  World\npeasants were displaced from land:  only one member of a family\nwas allowed to inherit land, as a result of which the others were\npushed into the labour market. Mineworkers were also confined in\ncompounds and not allowed to move about freely.\nThen came Rinderpest, a devastating cattle disease.\nRinderpest arrived in Africa in the late 1880s.  It was carried by\ninfected cattle imported from British Asia to feed the Italian soldiers\ninvading Eritrea in East Africa. Entering Africa in the east, rinderpest\nmoved west ‘like forest fire’, reaching Africa’s Atlantic coast in 1892.\nIt reached the Cape (Africa’s southernmost tip) five years later. Along\nthe way rinderpest killed 90 per cent of the cattle.\nThe loss of cattle destroyed African livelihoods. Planters, mine owners\nand colonial governments now successfully monopolised what scarce\ncattle resources remained, to strengthen their power and to force\nAfricans into the labour market. Control over the scarce resource\nof cattle enabled European colonisers to conquer and subdue Africa.\nSimilar stories can be told about the impact of Western conquest on\nother parts of the nineteenth-century world.\n2.4 Indentured Labour Migration from India\nThe example of indentured labour migration from India also\nillustrates the two-sided nature of the nineteenth-century world.\nIt was a world of faster economic growth as well as great misery,\nhigher incomes for some and poverty for others, technological\nadvances in some areas and new forms of coercion in others.\nIn the nineteenth century, hundreds of thousands of Indian and\nChinese labourers went to work on plantations, in mines, and in\nroad and railway construction projects around the world. In India,\nindentured labourers were hired under contracts which promised\nreturn travel to India after they had worked five years on their\nemployer’s plantation.\nMost Indian indentured workers came from the present-day regions\nof eastern Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, central India and the dry districts\nof Tamil Nadu. In the mid-nineteenth century these regions\nexperienced many changes – cottage industries declined, land rents\nrose, lands were cleared for mines and plantations. All this affected\nthe lives of the poor: they failed to pay their rents, became deeply\nindebted and were forced to migrate in search of work.\nNew words\nIndentured labour – A  bonded labourer under\ncontract to work for an employer for a specific\namount of time, to pay off his passage to a\nnew country or home\nReprint 2025-26\nIndia and the Contemporary World\n64\nDiscuss the importance of language and\npopular traditions in the creation of national\nidentity.\nThe main destinations of Indian indentured\nmigrants were the Caribbean islands (mainly\nTrinidad, Guyana and Surinam), Mauritius and Fiji.\nCloser home, Tamil migrants went to Ceylon and\nMalaya. Indentured workers were also recruited\nfor tea plantations in Assam.\nRecruitment was done by agents engaged by\nemployers and paid a small commission. Many\nmigrants agreed to take up work hoping to escape\npoverty or oppression in their home villages.\nAgents also tempted the prospective migrants\nby providing false information about final\ndestinations, modes of travel, the nature of the\nwork, and living and working conditions. Often\nmigrants were not even told that they were to embark on a long\nsea voyage. Sometimes agents even forcibly abducted less\nwilling migrants.\nNineteenth-century indenture has been described as a ‘new system\nof slavery’. On arrival at the plantations, labourers found conditions\nto be different from what they had imagined. Living and working\nconditions were harsh, and there were few legal rights.\nBut workers discovered their own ways of surviving. Many of them\nescaped into the wilds, though if caught they faced severe punishment.\nOthers developed new forms of individual and collective self-\nexpression, blending different cultural forms, old and new. In\nTrinidad the annual Muharram procession was transformed into a\nriotous carnival called ‘Hosay’ (for Imam Hussain) in which workers\nof all races and religions joined. Similarly, the protest religion of\nRastafarianism (made famous by the Jamaican reggae star Bob\nMarley) is also said to reflect social and cultural links with Indian\nmigrants to the Caribbean. ‘Chutney music’, popular in Trinidad\nand Guyana, is another creative contemporary expression of the\npost-indenture experience. These forms of cultural fusion are part\nof the making of the global world, where things from different\nplaces get mixed, lose their original characteristics and become\nsomething entirely new.\nMost indentured workers stayed on after their contracts ended, or\nreturned to their new homes after a short spell in India. Consequently,\nthere are large communities of people of Indian descent in these\ncountries. Have you heard of the Nobel Prize-winning writer\nFig. 14 — Indian indentured labourers in a cocoa plantation in\nTrinidad, early nineteenth century.\nDiscuss\nFig. 15 — Indentured laboureres photographed\nfor identification.\nFor the employers, the numbers and not the\nnames mattered.\nReprint 2025-26\n65\nThe  Making  of  a  Global  World\nV.S. Naipaul? Some of you may have followed the exploits of\nWest Indies cricketers Shivnarine Chanderpaul and Ramnaresh\nSarwan. If you have wondered why their names sound vaguely\nIndian, the answer is that they are descended from indentured\nlabour migrants from India.\nFrom the 1900s India’s nationalist leaders began opposing the system\nof indentured labour migration as abusive and cruel. It was abolished\nin 1921. Yet for a number of decades afterwards, descendants of\nIndian indentured workers, often thought of as ‘coolies’, remained\nan uneasy minority in the Caribbean islands. Some of Naipaul’s\nearly novels capture their sense of loss and alienation.\n2.5 Indian Entrepreneurs Abroad\nGrowing food and other crops for the world market required\ncapital. Large plantations could borrow it from banks and\nmarkets. But what about the humble peasant?\nEnter the Indian banker. Do you know of the Shikaripuri\nShroffs and Nattukottai  Chettiars? They were amongst the\nmany groups of bankers and traders who financed export\nagriculture in Central and Southeast Asia, using either their own\nfunds or those borrowed from European banks. They had a\nsophisticated system to transfer money over large distances, and\neven developed indigenous forms of corporate organisation.\nIndian traders and moneylenders also followed European\ncolonisers into Africa. Hyderabadi Sindhi traders, however,\nventured beyond European colonies. From the 1860s they\nestablished flourishing emporia at busy ports worldwide, selling\nlocal and imported curios to tourists whose numbers were\nbeginning to swell, thanks to the development of safe and\ncomfortable passenger vessels.\n2.6 Indian Trade, Colonialism and the Global System\nHistorically, fine cottons produced in India were exported  to\nEurope. With industrialisation, British cotton manufacture\nbegan to expand, and industrialists pressurised the government\nto restrict cotton imports and protect local industries. Tariffs\nwere imposed on cloth imports into Britain. Consequently, the\ninflow of fine Indian cotton began to decline.\nFrom the early nineteenth century, British manufacturers also began\nto seek overseas markets for their cloth. Excluded from the British\nFig. 16 — A contract form of an indentured\nlabourer.\nThe testimony of  an indentured labourer\nExtract from the testimony of Ram Narain\nTewary, an indentured labourer who spent ten\nyears on Demerara in the early twentieth century.\n‘… in spite of my best efforts, I could not properly\ndo the works that were allotted to me ...

If we look at the figures of exports\nfrom India, we see a steady decline of the share of cotton textiles:\nfrom some 30 per cent around 1800 to 15 per cent by 1815. By the\n1870s this proportion had dropped to below 3 per cent.\nWhat, then, did India export? The figures again tell a dramatic\nstory.  While exports of manufactures declined rapidly, export of\nraw materials increased equally fast. Between 1812 and 1871, the\nshare of raw cotton exports rose from 5 per cent to 35 per cent.\nIndigo used for dyeing cloth was another important export for\nFig. 17 – East India Company House, London.\nThis was the nerve centre of the worldwide operations of the East India Company.\nFig. 18 – A distant view of Surat\nand its river.\nAll through the seventeenth and early\neighteenth centuries, Surat remained\nthe main centre of overseas trade in\nthe western Indian Ocean.\nReprint 2025-26\n67\nThe  Making  of  a  Global  World\nFig. 19 – The trade routes that linked India to the world at the end of the seventeenth century.\nmany decades. And, as you have read last year, opium shipments to\nChina grew rapidly from the 1820s to become for a while India’s\nsingle largest export. Britain grew opium in India and exported it to\nChina and, with the money earned through this sale, it financed its\ntea and other imports from China.\nOver the nineteenth century, British manufactures flooded the Indian\nmarket. Food grain and raw material exports from India to Britain\nand the rest of the world increased. But the value of British exports\nto India was much higher than the value of British imports from\nIndia. Thus Britain had a ‘trade surplus’ with India. Britain used this\nsurplus to balance its trade deficits with other countries – that is,\nwith countries from which Britain was importing more than it was\nselling to. This is how a multilateral settlement system works – it\nallows one country’s deficit with another country to be settled\nby its surplus with a third country. By helping Britain balance its\ndeficits,  India played a crucial role in the late-nineteenth-century\nworld economy.\nBritain’s trade surplus in India also helped pay the so-called ‘home\ncharges’ that included private remittances home by British officials\nand traders, interest payments on India’s external debt, and pensions\nof British officials in India.\nSurat\nGoa\nMadras\nMasulipatam\nHoogly\nBangkok\nHanoi\nCanton\nMalacca\nBatavia\nBantam\nAcheh\nMuscat\nBandar Abbas\nBasra\nAleppo\nAlexandria\nJedda\nMacha\nLahore\nBukhara\nYarkand\nThe\nGreat\nWall\nMombasa\nMozambique\nSea route\nLand route\nVolume of trade passing through the port\nRed Sea\nPersian Gulf\nIndian Ocean\nReprint 2025-26\nIndia and the Contemporary World\n68\n3  The Inter-war Economy\nThe First World War (1914-18) was mainly fought in Europe. But\nits impact was felt around the world. Notably for our concerns\nin this chapter, it plunged the first half of the twentieth century\ninto a crisis that took over three decades to overcome. During\nthis period the world experienced widespread economic and\npolitical instability, and another catastrophic war.\n3.1 Wartime Transformations\nThe First World War, as you know, was fought between two power\nblocs. On the one side were the Allies – Britain, France and Russia\n(later joined by the US); and on the opposite side were the Central\nPowers – Germany, Austria-Hungary and Ottoman Turkey.  When\nthe war began in August 1914, many governments thought it would\nbe over by Christmas. It lasted more than four years.\nThe First World War was a war like no other before. The fighting\ninvolved the world’s leading industrial nations which now\nharnessed the vast powers of modern industry to inflict the greatest\npossible destruction on their enemies.\nThis war was thus the first modern industrial war. It saw the use\nof machine guns, tanks, aircraft, chemical weapons, etc. on a\nmassive scale. These were all increasingly products of modern large-\nscale industry. To fight the war, millions of soldiers\nhad to be recruited from around the world and\nmoved to the frontlines on large ships and trains.\nThe scale of death and destruction – 9 million dead\nand 20 million injured – was unthinkable before the\nindustrial age, without the use of industrial arms.\nMost of the killed and maimed were men of\nworking age. These deaths and injuries reduced the\nable-bodied workforce in Europe. With fewer\nnumbers within the family, household incomes\ndeclined after the war.\nDuring the war, industries were restructured to\nproduce war-related goods. Entire societies were\nalso reorganised for war – as men went to battle,\nwomen stepped in to undertake jobs that earlier only\nmen were expected to do.\nFig. 20 – Workers in a munition factory during the First World\nWar.\nProduction  of armaments increased rapidly to meet war demands.\nReprint 2025-26\n69\nThe  Making  of  a  Global  World\nThe war led to the snapping of economic links between some of\nthe world’s largest economic powers which were now fighting\neach other to pay for them. So Britain borrowed large sums\nof money from US banks as well as the US public. Thus the war\ntransformed the US from being an international debtor to an\ninternational creditor. In other words, at the war’s end, the US and\nits citizens owned more overseas assets than foreign governments\nand citizens owned in the US.\n3.2 Post-war Recovery\nPost-war economic recovery proved difficult. Britain, which was\nthe world’s leading economy in the pre-war period, in particular\nfaced a prolonged crisis. While Britain was preoccupied with war,\nindustries had developed in India and Japan. After the war Britain\nfound it difficult to recapture its earlier position of dominance in\nthe Indian market, and to compete with Japan internationally.\nMoreover, to finance war expenditures Britain had borrowed liberally\nfrom the US. This meant that at the end of the war Britain was\nburdened with huge external debts.\nThe war had led to an economic boom, that is, to a large increase in\ndemand, production and employment. When the war boom ended,\nproduction contracted and unemployment increased. At the\nsame time the government reduced bloated war expenditures to\nbring them into line with peacetime revenues. These developments\nled to huge job losses – in 1921 one in every five British workers\nwas out of work. Indeed, anxiety and uncertainty about work\nbecame an enduring part of the post-war scenario.\nMany agricultural economies were also in crisis. Consider the case\nof wheat producers. Before the war, eastern Europe was a major\nsupplier of wheat in the world market. When this supply was\ndisrupted during the war, wheat production in Canada, America\nand Australia expanded dramatically. But once the war was over,\nproduction in eastern Europe revived and created a glut in wheat\noutput. Grain prices fell, rural incomes declined, and farmers fell\ndeeper into debt.\n3.3 Rise of Mass Production and Consumption\nIn the US, recovery was quicker. We have already seen how the war\nhelped boost the US economy. After a short period of economic\nReprint 2025-26\nIndia and the Contemporary World\n70\ntrouble in the years after the war, the US  economy resumed\nits strong growth in the early 1920s.\nOne important feature of the US economy of the 1920s\nwas mass production. The move towards mass production\nhad begun in the late nineteenth century, but in the 1920s it\nbecame a characteristic feature of industrial production in\nthe US. A well-known pioneer of mass production was the\ncar manufacturer Henry Ford. He adapted the assembly line\nof a Chicago slaughterhouse (in which slaughtered animals\nwere picked apart by butchers as they came down a conveyor\nbelt) to his new car plant in Detroit. He realised that the\n‘assembly line’ method would allow a faster and cheaper way\nof producing vehicles. The assembly line forced workers to\nrepeat a single task mechanically and continuously – such as\nfitting a particular part to the car – at a pace dictated by the\nconveyor belt. This was a way of increasing the output per worker\nby speeding up the pace of work. Standing in front of a conveyor\nbelt no worker could afford to delay the motions, take a break, or\neven have a friendly word with a workmate. As a result, Henry\nFord’s cars came off the assembly line at three-minute intervals, a\nspeed much faster than that achieved by previous methods. The T-\nModel Ford was the world’s first mass-produced car.\nAt first workers at the Ford  factory were unable to cope with the\nstress of working on assembly lines in which they could not control\nthe pace of work. So they quit in large numbers. In desperation\nFord doubled the daily wage to $5 in January 1914. At the same\ntime he banned trade unions from operating in his plants.\nHenry Ford recovered the high wage by repeatedly speeding up\nthe production line and forcing workers to work ever harder. So\nmuch so, he would soon describe his decision to double the daily\nwage as the ‘best cost-cutting decision’ he had ever made.\nFordist industrial practices soon spread in the US. They were also\nwidely copied in Europe in the 1920s. Mass production lowered\ncosts and prices of engineered goods. Thanks to higher wages,\nmore workers could now afford to purchase durable consumer\ngoods such as cars. Car production in the US rose from 2 million in\n1919 to more than 5 million in 1929. Similarly, there was a spurt\nin the purchase of refrigerators, washing machines, radios,\ngramophone players, all through a system of ‘hire purchase’ (i.e., on\nFig. 21 – T-Model automobiles lined up outside the\nfactory.\nReprint 2025-26\n71\nThe  Making  of  a  Global  World\ncredit repaid in weekly or monthly instalments). The demand\nfor refrigerators, washing machines, etc. was also fuelled by a boom\nin house construction and home ownership, financed once again\nby loans.\nThe housing and consumer boom of the 1920s created the basis of\nprosperity in the US. Large investments in housing and household\ngoods seemed to create a cycle of higher employment\nand incomes, rising consumption demand, more investment, and\nyet more employment and incomes.\nIn 1923, the US resumed exporting capital to the rest of the world\nand became the largest overseas lender. US imports and capital\nexports also boosted European recovery and world trade and\nincome growth over the next six years.\nAll this, however, proved  too good to last. By 1929 the world\nwould be plunged into a depression such as it had never\nexperienced before.\n3.4 The Great Depression\nThe Great Depression began around 1929 and lasted till the mid-\n1930s. During this period most parts of the world experienced\ncatastrophic declines in production, employment, incomes and\ntrade. The exact timing and impact of the depression varied\nacross countries. But in general, agricultural regions and communities\nwere the worst affected. This was because the fall\nin agricultural prices was greater and more prolonged than that\nin the prices of industrial goods.\nThe depression was caused by a combination of several factors. We\nhave already seen how fragile the post-war world economy was.\nFirst: agricultural overproduction remained a problem. This was\nmade worse by falling agricultural prices. As prices slumped and\nagricultural incomes declined, farmers tried to expand production\nand bring a larger volume of produce to the market to maintain\ntheir overall income. This worsened the glut in the market, pushing\ndown prices even further. Farm produce rotted for a lack of buyers.\nSecond: in the mid-1920s, many countries financed their investments\nthrough loans from the US. While it was often extremely easy to\nraise loans in the US when the going was good, US overseas lenders\npanicked at the first sign of trouble. In the first half of 1928, US\nMany years later, Dorothea Lange, the\nphotographer who shot this picture, recollected\nthe moment of her encounter with the\nhungry mother:\n‘I saw and approached the hungry and desperate\nmother, as if drawn by a magnet … I did not ask\nher name or her history. She told me her age,\nthat she was thirty-two. She said that they\n(i.e., she and her seven children) had been living\non frozen vegetables from the surrounding fields,\nand birds that the children killed … There she\nsat … with her children huddled around her,\nand seemed to know that my pictures might\nhelp her, and so she helped me …’\nFrom: Popular Photography, February 1960.\nBox 3\nFig. 22 – Migrant agricultural worker’s family,\nhomeless and hungry, during the Great\nDepression, 1936.

A year later it was one\nquarter of that amount. Countries that depended crucially on US\nloans now faced an acute crisis.\nThe withdrawal of US loans affected much of the rest of the world,\nthough in different ways. In Europe it led to the failure of some\nmajor banks and the collapse of currencies such as the British pound\nsterling. In Latin America and elsewhere it intensified the slump\nin agricultural and raw material prices. The US attempt to protect\nits economy in the depression by doubling import duties also dealt\nanother severe blow to world trade.\nThe US was also the industrial country most severely affected by\nthe depression. With the fall in prices and the prospect of a\ndepression, US banks had also slashed domestic lending and\ncalled back loans. Farms could not sell their harvests, households\nwere ruined, and businesses collapsed. Faced with falling\nincomes, many households in the US could not repay what they had\nborrowed, and were forced to give up their homes, cars and other\nconsumer durables. The consumerist prosperity of the 1920s now\ndisappeared in a puff of dust. As unemployment soared, people\ntrudged long distances looking for any work they could find.\nUltimately, the US banking system itself collapsed. Unable to\nrecover investments, collect loans and repay depositors, thousands\nof banks went bankrupt and were forced to close. The numbers\nare phenomenal: by 1933 over 4,000 banks had closed and\nbetween 1929 and 1932 about 110, 000 companies had collapsed.\nBy 1935, a modest economic recovery was under way in most\nindustrial countries. But the Great Depression’s wider effects on\nsociety, politics and international relations, and on peoples’ minds,\nproved more enduring.\n3.5 India and the Great Depression\nIf we look at the impact of the depression on India we realise\nhow integrated the global economy had become by the early\ntwentieth century. The tremors of a crisis in one part of the world\nwere quickly relayed to other parts, affecting lives, economies and\nsocieties worldwide.\nIn the nineteenth century, as you have seen, colonial India had become\nan exporter of agricultural goods and importer of manufactures.\nThe depression immediately affected Indian trade. India’s exports\nFig. 23 – People lining up for unemployment\nbenefits, US, photograph by Dorothea Lange,\n1938.

As international\nprices crashed, prices in India also plunged. Between 1928 and 1934,\nwheat prices in India fell by 50 per cent.\nPeasants and farmers suffered more than urban dwellers. Though\nagricultural prices fell sharply, the colonial government refused to\nreduce revenue demands. Peasants producing for the world market\nwere the worst hit.\nConsider the jute producers of Bengal. They grew raw jute that was\nprocessed in factories for export in the form of gunny bags. But\nas gunny exports collapsed, the price of raw jute crashed more than\n60 per cent. Peasants who borrowed in the hope of better times or\nto increase output in the hope of higher incomes faced ever lower\nprices, and fell deeper and deeper into debt. Thus the Bengal jute\ngrowers’ lament:\nAcross India, peasants’ indebtedness increased. They used up their\nsavings, mortgaged lands, and sold whatever jewellery and precious\nmetals they had to meet their expenses. In these depression years,\nIndia became an exporter of precious metals, notably gold.\nThe famous economist John Maynard Keynes thought that Indian\ngold exports promoted global economic recovery. They certainly\nhelped speed up Britain’s recovery, but did little for the Indian peasant.\nRural India was thus seething with unrest when Mahatma Gandhi\nlaunched the civil disobedience movement at the height of the\ndepression in 1931.\nThe depression proved less grim for urban India. Because of falling\nprices, those with fixed incomes – say town-dwelling landowners\nwho received rents and middle-class salaried employees – now found\nthemselves better off. Everything cost less. Industrial investment also\ngrew as the government extended tariff protection to industries,\nunder the pressure of nationalist opinion.\nWho profits from jute cultivation according to the\njute growers’ lament?

It was fought between the Axis powers\n(mainly Nazi Germany, Japan and Italy)  and the Allies (Britain,\nFrance, the Soviet Union and the US). It was a war waged for six\nyears on many fronts, in many places, over land, on sea, in the air.\nOnce again death and destruction was enormous. At least 60 million\npeople, or about 3 per cent of the world’s 1939 population, are\nbelieved to have been killed, directly or indirectly, as a result of the\nwar. Millions more were injured.\nUnlike in earlier wars, most of these deaths took place outside the\nbattlefields. Many more civilians than soldiers died from war-related\ncauses. Vast parts of Europe and Asia were devastated, and several\ncities were destroyed by aerial bombardment or relentless\nartillery attacks. The war caused an immense amount of economic\ndevastation and social disruption. Reconstruction promised to\nbe long and difficult.\nTwo crucial influences shaped post-war\nreconstruction. The first was the US’s\nemergence as the dominant economic, political\nand military power in the Western world. The\nsecond was the dominance of the Soviet\nUnion. It had made huge sacrifices to defeat\nNazi Germany, and transformed itself from\na backward agricultural country into a world\npower during the very years when the capitalist\nworld was trapped in the Great Depression.\n4.1 Post-war Settlement and the\nBretton Woods Institutions\nEconomists and politicians drew two key lessons from inter-war\neconomic experiences. First, an industrial society based on mass\nproduction cannot be sustained without mass consumption. But to\nensure mass consumption, there was a need for high and stable\nincomes. Incomes could not be stable if employment was unstable.\nThus stable incomes also required steady, full employment.\nBut markets alone could not guarantee full employment.\nTherefore governments would have to step in to minimise\nFig. 24 – German forces attack Russia, July 1941.\nHitler’s attempt to invade Russia was a turning\npoint in the war.\nFig. 25 – Stalingrad in Soviet Russia devastated by the war.\nReprint 2025-26\n75\nThe  Making  of  a  Global  World\nBriefly summarise the two lessons learnt by\neconomists and politicians from the inter-war\neconomic experience?\nDiscuss\nfluctuations of price, output and employment. Economic stability\ncould be ensured only through the intervention of the government.\nThe second lesson related to a country’s economic links with\nthe outside world. The goal of full employment could only be\nachieved if governments had power to control flows of goods,\ncapital and labour.\nThus in brief, the main aim of the post-war international economic\nsystem was to preserve economic stability and full employment in\nthe industrial world. Its framework was agreed upon at the United\nNations Monetary and Financial Conference held in July 1944 at\nBretton Woods in New Hampshire, USA.\nThe Bretton Woods conference established the International Monetary\nFund (IMF) to deal with external surpluses and deficits of its member\nnations. The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development\n(popularly known as the World Bank) was set up to finance post-\nwar reconstruction. The IMF and the World Bank are referred to\nas the Bretton Woods institutions or sometimes the Bretton Woods\ntwins. The post-war international economic system is also often\ndescribed as the Bretton Woods system.\nThe IMF and the World Bank commenced financial operations\nin 1947. Decision-making in these institutions is controlled by\nthe Western industrial powers. The US has an effective right of\nveto over key IMF and World Bank decisions.\nThe international monetary system is the system linking national\ncurrencies and monetary system. The Bretton Woods system was\nbased on fixed exchange rates. In this system, national currencies,\nfor example the Indian rupee, were pegged to the dollar at a fixed\nexchange rate. The dollar itself was anchored to gold at a fixed\nprice of $35 per ounce of gold.\n4.2 The Early Post-war Years\nThe Bretton Woods system inaugurated an era of unprecedented\ngrowth of trade and incomes for the Western industrial nations and\nJapan. World trade grew annually at over 8 per cent between 1950\nand 1970 and incomes at nearly 5 per cent. The growth was also\nmostly stable, without large fluctuations. For much of this period\nthe unemployment rate, for example, averaged less than 5 per cent\nin most industrial countries.\nFig. 26 – Mount Washington Hotel situated in\nBretton Woods, US.\nThis is the place where the famous conference\nwas held.\nReprint 2025-26\nIndia and the Contemporary World\n76\nThese decades also saw the worldwide spread of technology and\nenterprise. Developing countries were in a hurry to catch up with\nthe advanced industrial countries. Therefore, they invested vast\namounts of capital, importing industrial plant and equipment\nfeaturing modern technology.\n4.3 Decolonisation and Independence\nWhen the Second World War ended, large parts of the world were\nstill under European colonial rule. Over the next two decades most\ncolonies in Asia and Africa emerged as free, independent nations.\nThey were, however, overburdened by poverty and a lack of\nresources, and their economies and societies were handicapped by\nlong periods of colonial rule.\nThe IMF and the World Bank were designed to meet the financial\nneeds of the industrial countries. They were not equipped to cope\nwith the challenge of poverty and lack of development in the former\ncolonies. But as Europe and Japan rapidly rebuilt their economies,\nthey grew less dependent on the IMF and the World Bank. Thus\nfrom the late 1950s the Bretton Woods institutions began to shift\ntheir attention more towards developing countries.\nAs colonies, many of the less developed regions of the world had\nbeen part of Western empires. Now, ironically, as newly independent\ncountries facing urgent pressures to lift their populations out of\npoverty, they came under the guidance of international agencies\ndominated by the former colonial powers. Even after many years\nof decolonisation, the former colonial powers still controlled vital\nresources such as minerals and land in many of their former colonies.\nLarge corporations of other powerful countries, for example the\nUS, also often managed to secure rights to exploit developing\ncountries’ natural resources very cheaply.\nAt the same time, most developing countries did not benefit from\nthe fast growth the Western economies experienced in the 1950s\nand 1960s. Therefore they organised themselves as a group – the\nGroup of 77 (or G-77) – to demand a new international economic\norder (NIEO). By the NIEO they meant a system that would give\nthem real control over their natural resources, more development\nassistance, fairer prices for raw materials, and better access for their\nmanufactured goods in developed countries’ markets.\nNew words\nTariff – Tax imposed on a country’s imports\nfrom the rest of  the world. Tariffs are\nlevied at the point of entry, i.e., at the border\nor the airport.\nWhat are MNCs?\nMultinational corporations (MNCs) are large\ncompanies that operate in several countries at\nthe same time. The first MNCs were established\nin the 1920s. Many more came up in the 1950s\nand 1960s as US businesses expanded worldwide\nand Western Europe and Japan also recovered\nto become powerful industrial economies. The\nworldwide spread of MNCs was a notable feature\nof the 1950s and 1960s. This was partly because\nhigh import tariffs imposed by different\ngovernments forced MNCs to locate their\nmanufacturing operations and become ‘domestic\nproducers’ in as many countries as possible.\nBox 4\nReprint 2025-26\n77\nThe  Making  of  a  Global  World\n4.4 End of Bretton Woods and the Beginning of\n‘Globalisation’\nDespite years of stable and rapid growth, not all was well in\nthis post-war world. From the 1960s the rising costs of its\noverseas involvements weakened the US’s finances and competitive\nstrength. The US dollar now no longer commanded confidence\nas the world’s principal currency. It could not maintain its value\nin relation to gold. This eventually led to the collapse of the\nsystem of fixed exchange rates and the introduction of a system\nof floating exchange rates.\nFrom the mid-1970s the international financial system also changed\nin important ways. Earlier, developing countries could turn to\ninternational institutions for loans and development assistance. But\nnow they were forced to borrow from Western commercial banks\nand private lending institutions. This led to periodic debt crises in\nthe developing world, and lower incomes and increased poverty,\nespecially in Africa and Latin America.\nThe industrial world was also hit by unemployment that began\nrising from the mid-1970s and remained high until the early 1990s.\nFrom the late 1970s MNCs also began to shift production operations\nto low-wage Asian countries.\nChina had been cut off from the post-war world economy since\nits revolution in 1949. But new economic policies in China and\nthe collapse of the Soviet Union and Soviet-style communism in\nEastern Europe brought many countries back into the fold of the\nworld economy.\nWages were relatively low in countries like China. Thus they became\nattractive destinations for investment by foreign MNCs competing\nto capture world markets. Have you noticed that most of the TVs,\nmobile phones, and toys we see in the shops seem to be made in\nChina? This is because of the low-cost structure of the Chinese\neconomy, most importantly its low wages.\nThe relocation of industry to low-wage countries stimulated world\ntrade and capital flows. In the last two decades the world’s economic\ngeography has been transformed as countries such as India, China\nand Brazil have undergone rapid economic transformation.\nNew words\nExchange rates –  They link national currencies\nfor purposes of international trade.

It also meant a change\nin people’s understanding of who they were, and what defined their\nidentity and sense of belonging. New symbols and icons, new songs\nand ideas forged new links and redefined the boundaries of\ncommunities. In most countries the making of this new national\nidentity was a long process. How did this consciousness emerge\nin India?\nIn India and as in  many other colonies, the growth of modern\nnationalism is intimately connected to the anti-colonial movement.\nPeople began discovering their unity in the process of their struggle\nwith colonialism. The sense of being oppressed under colonialism\nprovided a shared bond that tied many different groups together.\nBut each class and group felt the effects of colonialism differently,\ntheir experiences were varied, and their notions of freedom were\nnot always the same.  The Congress under Mahatma Gandhi tried\nto forge these groups together within one movement. But the unity\ndid not emerge without conflict.\nIn an earlier textbook you have read about the growth of nationalism\nin India up to the first decade of the twentieth century. In this chapter\nwe will pick up the story from the 1920s and study the Non-\nCooperation and Civil Disobedience Movements. We will explore\nhow the Congress sought to develop the national movement, how\ndifferent social groups participated in the movement, and how\nnationalism captured the imagination of people.\nNationalism  in  India\nChapter II\nNationalism in India\nFig. 1 – 6 April 1919.\nMass processions on\nthe streets became a\ncommon feature during\nthe national movement.\nReprint 2025-26\nIndia and the Contemporary World\n30\n1  The First World War, Khilafat and Non-Cooperation\nIn the years after 1919, we see the national movement spreading to\nnew areas, incorporating new social groups, and developing new\nmodes of struggle. How do we understand these developments?\nWhat implications did they have?\nFirst of all, the war created a new economic and political situation.\nIt led to a huge increase in defence expenditure which was financed\nby war loans and increasing taxes: customs duties were raised and\nincome tax introduced. Through the war years prices increased –\ndoubling between 1913 and 1918 –  leading to extreme hardship\nfor the common people. Villages were called upon to supply soldiers,\nand the forced recruitment in rural areas caused widespread anger.\nThen in 1918-19 and 1920-21, crops failed in many parts of India,\nresulting in acute shortages of food. This was accompanied by an\ninfluenza epidemic. According to the census of 1921, 12 to 13 million\npeople perished as a result of famines and  the epidemic.\nPeople hoped that their hardships would end after the war was\nover. But that did not happen.\nAt this stage a new leader appeared and suggested a new mode\nof struggle.\n1.1 The Idea of Satyagraha\nMahatma Gandhi returned to India in January 1915. As you know,\nhe had come from South Africa where he had successfully fought\nNew words\nForced recruitment – A process by which the\ncolonial state forced people to join the army\nFig. 2 – Indian workers in South\nAfrica march through Volksrust, 6\nNovember 1913.\nMahatma Gandhi was leading the\nworkers from Newcastle to\nTransvaal. When the marchers were\nstopped and Gandhiji arrested,\nthousands of more workers joined\nthe satyagraha against racist laws\nthat denied rights  to non-whites.\nReprint 2025-26\n31\nNationalism  in  India\nthe racist regime with a novel method of mass agitation, which he\ncalled satyagraha. The idea of satyagraha emphasised the power of\ntruth and the need to search for truth. It suggested that if the cause\nwas true, if the struggle was against injustice, then physical force was\nnot necessary to fight the oppressor. Without seeking vengeance or\nbeing aggressive, a satyagrahi could win the battle through non-\nviolence. This could be done by  appealing to the conscience of the\noppressor. People – including the oppressors – had to be persuaded\nto see the truth, instead of being forced to accept truth through the\nuse of violence. By this struggle, truth was bound to ultimately\ntriumph. Mahatma Gandhi believed that this dharma of non-violence\ncould unite all Indians.\nAfter arriving in India, Mahatma Gandhi successfully organised\nsatyagraha movements in various places. In 1917 he travelled to\nChamparan in  Bihar to inspire the peasants to struggle against the\noppressive plantation system. Then in 1917,  he organised a satyagraha\nto support the peasants of the Kheda district of Gujarat. Affected\nby crop failure and a plague epidemic, the peasants of Kheda could\nnot pay the revenue, and were demanding that revenue collection be\nrelaxed. In 1918, Mahatma Gandhi went to Ahmedabad to organise\na satyagraha movement amongst cotton mill workers.\n1.2 The Rowlatt Act\nEmboldened with this success, Gandhiji in 1919 decided to launch a\nnationwide satyagraha against the proposed Rowlatt Act (1919). This\nAct had been hurriedly passed through the Imperial Legislative\nCouncil despite the united opposition of the Indian members. It\ngave the government enormous powers to repress political activities,\nand allowed detention of political prisoners without trial for two\nyears. Mahatma Gandhi wanted non-violent civil disobedience against\nsuch unjust laws, which would start with a hartal on 6 April.\nRallies were organised in various cities, workers went on strike in\nrailway workshops, and shops closed down. Alarmed by the popular\nupsurge, and scared that lines of communication such as the railways\nand telegraph would be disrupted, the British administration decided\nto clamp down on nationalists. Local leaders were picked up from\nAmritsar, and Mahatma Gandhi was barred from entering Delhi.\nOn 10 April, the police in Amritsar fired upon a peaceful procession,\nprovoking widespread attacks on banks, post offices and railway\nstations. Martial law was imposed and General Dyer took command.\nMahatma Gandhi on Satyagraha\n‘It is said of “passive resistance” that it is the\nweapon of the weak, but the power which is\nthe subject of this article can be used only\nby the strong. This power is not passive\nresistance; indeed it calls for intense activity. The\nmovement in South Africa was not passive\nbut active  …\n‘ Satyagraha is not physical force. A satyagrahi\ndoes not inflict pain on the adversary; he does\nnot seek his destruction … In the use of\nsatyagraha, there is no ill-will whatever.\n‘ Satyagraha is pure soul-force. Truth is the very\nsubstance of the soul. That is why this force is\ncalled satyagraha. The soul is informed with\nknowledge. In it burns the flame of love. … Non-\nviolence is the supreme dharma …\n‘It is certain that India cannot rival Britain or\nEurope in force of arms. The British worship the\nwar-god and they can all of them become, as\nthey are becoming, bearers of arms. The\nhundreds of millions in India can never carry arms.\nThey have made the religion of non-violence their\nown ...’\nSource\nSource A\nRead the text carefully. What did Mahatma\nGandhi mean when he said satyagraha is\nactive resistance?\nActivity\nReprint 2025-26\nIndia and the Contemporary World\n32\nOn 13 April the infamous Jallianwalla Bagh incident took place. On\nthat day a large crowd gathered in the enclosed ground of Jallianwalla\nBagh. Some came to protest against the government’s new repressive\nmeasures. Others had come to attend the annual Baisakhi fair.  Being\nfrom outside the city, many villagers were unaware of the martial\nlaw that had been imposed. Dyer entered the area, blocked the exit\npoints, and opened fire on the crowd, killing hundreds. His object,\nas he declared later, was to ‘produce a moral effect’, to create in the\nminds of satyagrahis a feeling of terror and awe.\nAs the news of Jallianwalla Bagh spread, crowds took to the streets\nin many north Indian towns. There were strikes, clashes with the\npolice and attacks on government buildings. The government\nresponded with brutal repression, seeking to humiliate and terrorise\npeople: satyagrahis were forced to rub their noses on the ground,\ncrawl on the streets, and do salaam (salute) to all sahibs; people were\nflogged and villages (around Gujranwala in Punjab, now in Pakistan)\nwere bombed. Seeing violence spread, Mahatma Gandhi called off\nthe movement.\nWhile the Rowlatt satyagraha had been a widespread movement, it\nwas still limited mostly to cities and towns. Mahatma Gandhi now felt\nthe need to launch a more broad-based movement in India.  But he\nwas certain that no such movement could be organised without\nbringing the Hindus and Muslims closer together. One way of doing\nthis, he felt, was to take up the Khilafat issue. The First World War had\nended with the defeat of Ottoman Turkey. And there were rumours\nthat a harsh peace treaty was going to be imposed on the Ottoman\nemperor –  the spiritual head of the Islamic world (the Khalifa). To\ndefend the Khalifa’s temporal powers, a Khilafat Committee was\nformed in Bombay in March 1919. A young generation of Muslim\nleaders like the brothers Muhammad Ali and Shaukat Ali, began\ndiscussing with Mahatma Gandhi about the possibility of a united\nmass action on the issue. Gandhiji saw this as an opportunity to bring\nMuslims under the umbrella of a unified national movement. At the\nCalcutta session of the Congress in September 1920, he convinced\nother leaders of the need to start a non-cooperation movement in\nsupport of Khilafat as well as for swaraj.\n1.3  Why Non-cooperation?\nIn his famous book Hind Swaraj (1909) Mahatma Gandhi declared\nthat British rule was established in India with the cooperation of\nFig. 3 – General Dyer’s ‘crawling orders’ being\nadministered by British soldiers, Amritsar,\nPunjab, 1919.\nReprint 2025-26\n33\nNationalism  in  India\nNew words\nBoycott – The refusal to deal and associate with\npeople, or participate in activities, or buy and\nuse things; usually a form of protest\nIndians, and had survived only because of this cooperation. If Indians\nrefused to cooperate, British rule in India would collapse within a\nyear, and swaraj would come.\nHow could non-cooperation become a movement? Gandhiji\nproposed that the movement should unfold in stages. It should begin\nwith the surrender of titles that the government awarded, and a\nboycott of civil services, army, police, courts and legislative councils,\nschools, and foreign goods. Then, in case the government used\nrepression, a full civil disobedience campaign would be launched.\nThrough the summer of 1920 Mahatma Gandhi and Shaukat Ali\ntoured extensively, mobilising popular support for the movement.\nMany within the Congress were, however, concerned about the\nproposals. They were reluctant to boycott the council elections\nscheduled for November 1920, and they feared that the movement\nmight lead to popular violence.  In the months between September\nand December there was an intense tussle within the Congress. For a\nwhile there seemed no meeting point between the supporters and\nthe opponents of the movement. Finally, at the Congress session at\nNagpur in December 1920, a compromise was worked out and\nthe Non-Cooperation programme was adopted.\nHow did the movement unfold? Who participated in it? How did\ndifferent social groups conceive of the idea of Non-Cooperation?\nFig. 4 – The boycott of foreign\ncloth, July 1922.\nForeign cloth was seen as the\nsymbol of Western economic\nand cultural domination.\nReprint 2025-26\nIndia and the Contemporary World\n34\n2  Differing Strands within the Movement\nThe Non-Cooperation-Khilafat Movement began in January 1921.\nVarious social groups participated in this movement, each with its\nown specific aspiration. All of them responded to the call of Swaraj,\nbut the term meant different things to different people.\n2.1 The Movement in the Towns\nThe movement started with middle-class participation in the cities.\nThousands of students left government-controlled schools and\ncolleges, headmasters and teachers resigned, and lawyers gave up\ntheir legal practices. The council elections were boycotted in most\nprovinces except Madras, where the Justice Party, the party of the\nnon-Brahmans, felt that entering the council was one way of gaining\nsome power – something that usually only Brahmans had access to.\nThe effects of non-cooperation on the economic front were more\ndramatic. Foreign goods were boycotted, liquor shops picketed,\nand foreign cloth burnt in huge bonfires. The import of foreign\ncloth halved between 1921 and 1922, its value dropping from\nRs 102 crore to Rs 57 crore. In many places merchants and traders\nrefused to trade in foreign goods or finance foreign trade. As the\nboycott movement spread, and people began discarding imported\nclothes and wearing only Indian ones, production of Indian textile\nmills and handlooms went up.\nBut this movement in the cities gradually slowed down for a variety\nof reasons. Khadi cloth was often more expensive than mass-\nproduced mill cloth and poor people could not afford to buy it.\nHow then could they boycott mill cloth for too long? Similarly the\nboycott of British institutions posed a problem. For the movement\nto be successful, alternative Indian institutions had to be set up\nso that they could be used in place of the British ones. These were\nslow to come up. So students and teachers began trickling\nback to government schools and lawyers joined back work in\ngovernment courts.\n2.2 Rebellion in the Countryside\nFrom the cities, the Non-Cooperation Movement spread to the\ncountryside. It drew into its fold the struggles of peasants and tribals\nNew words\nPicket – A form of demonstration or protest\nby which people block the entrance to a shop,\nfactory or office\nThe year is 1921.

The movement\nhere was against talukdars and landlords who demanded from\npeasants exorbitantly high rents and a variety of other cesses. Peasants\nhad to do begar and work at landlords’ farms without any payment.\nAs tenants they had no security of tenure, being regularly evicted so\nthat they could acquire no right over the leased land. The peasant\nmovement demanded reduction of revenue, abolition of begar, and\nsocial boycott of oppressive landlords. In many places nai – dhobi\nbandhs were organised by panchayats to deprive landlords of the\nservices of even barbers and washermen. In June 1920, Jawaharlal\nNehru began going around the villages in Awadh, talking to the\nvillagers, and trying to understand their grievances. By October, the\nOudh Kisan Sabha was set up headed by Jawaharlal Nehru, Baba\nRamchandra and a few others. Within a month, over 300 branches\nhad been set up in the villages around the region. So when the Non-\nCooperation Movement began the following year, the effort of the\nCongress was to integrate the Awadh peasant struggle into the wider\nstruggle. The peasant movement, however, developed in forms that\nthe Congress leadership was unhappy with. As the movement spread\nin 1921, the houses of talukdars and merchants were attacked,\nbazaars were looted, and grain hoards were taken over. In many\nplaces local leaders told peasants that Gandhiji had declared that\nno taxes were to be paid and land was to be redistributed among\nthe poor. The name of the Mahatma was being invoked to sanction\nall action and aspirations.\nNew words\nBegar – Labour that villagers were forced to\ncontribute without any payment\nIf you were a peasant in Uttar Pradesh in 1920,\nhow would you have responded to Gandhiji’s\ncall for Swaraj?

Jawaharlal Nehru wanted to go to\nthe place of firing, but was stopped by the police. Agitated and angry, Nehru addressed the peasants who gathered\naround him. This is how he later described the meeting:\n‘They behaved as brave men, calm and unruffled in the face of danger. I do not know how they felt but I know what\nmy feelings were. For a moment my blood was up, non-violence was almost forgotten – but for a moment only. The\nthought of the great leader, who by God’s goodness has been sent to lead us to victory, came to me, and I saw the\nkisans seated and standing near me, less excited, more peaceful than I was – and the moment of weakness passed, I\nspoke to them in all humility on non-violence – I needed the lesson more than they – and they heeded me and\npeacefully dispersed.’\nQuoted in Sarvapalli Gopal, Jawaharlal Nehru: A Biography, Vol. I.\nSource\nSource B\nIn 1928, Vallabhbhai Patel led the peasant\nmovement in Bardoli, a taluka in Gujarat, against\nenhancement of land revenue. Known as the\nBardoli Satyagraha, this movement was a success\nunder the able leadership of Vallabhbhai Patel.\nThe struggle was widely publicised and\ngenerated immense sympathy in many parts\nof India.\nReprint 2025-26\nIndia and the Contemporary World\n36\nTribal peasants interpreted the message of Mahatma Gandhi and\nthe idea of swaraj in yet another way. In the Gudem Hills of Andhra\nPradesh, for instance, a militant guerrilla movement spread in\nthe early 1920s –  not a form of struggle that the Congress could\napprove. Here, as in other forest regions, the colonial government\nhad closed large forest areas, preventing people from entering\nthe forests to graze their cattle, or to collect fuelwood and fruits.\nThis enraged the hill people. Not only were their livelihoods\naffected but they felt that their traditional rights were being denied.\nWhen the government began forcing them to contribute begar\nfor road building, the hill people revolted. The person who came\nto lead them was an interesting figure. Alluri Sitaram Raju claimed\nthat he had a variety of special powers: he could make correct\nastrological predictions and heal people, and he could survive\neven bullet shots. Captivated by Raju, the rebels proclaimed that\nhe was an incarnation of God. Raju talked of the greatness of\nMahatma Gandhi, said he was inspired by the Non-Cooperation\nMovement, and persuaded people to wear khadi and give up drinking.\nBut at the same time he asserted that India could be liberated only\nby the use of force, not non-violence. The Gudem rebels attacked\npolice stations, attempted to kill British officials and carried on\nguerrilla warfare for achieving swaraj.  Raju was captured and\nexecuted in 1924, and over time became a folk hero.\n2.3 Swaraj in the Plantations\nWorkers too had their own understanding of Mahatma Gandhi\nand the notion of swaraj.  For plantation workers in Assam, freedom\nmeant the right to move freely in and out of the confined space in\nwhich they were enclosed, and it meant retaining a link with the\nvillage from which they had come. Under the Inland Emigration\nAct of 1859, plantation workers were not permitted to leave the\ntea gardens without permission, and in fact they were rarely given\nsuch permission. When they heard of the Non-Cooperation\nMovement, thousands of workers defied the authorities, left the\nplantations and headed home. They believed that Gandhi Raj was\ncoming and everyone would be given land in their own villages.\nThey, however, never reached their destination. Stranded on the way\nby a railway and steamer strike, they were caught by the police and\nbrutally beaten up.\nFind out about other participants in the\nNational Movement who were captured and\nput to death by the British.

They interpreted the term swaraj in their own ways,\nimagining it to be a time when all suffering and all troubles would\nbe over. Yet, when the tribals chanted Gandhiji’s name and raised\nslogans demanding ‘Swatantra Bharat’, they were also emotionally\nrelating to an all-India agitation. When they acted in the name of\nMahatma Gandhi, or linked their movement to that of the Congress,\nthey were identifying with a movement which went beyond the limits\nof their immediate locality.\nFig. 5 – Chauri Chaura, 1922.\nAt Chauri Chaura in Gorakhpur, a peaceful demonstration in a bazaar turned into a\nviolent clash with the police. Hearing of the incident, Mahatma Gandhi called a halt\nto the Non-Cooperation Movement.\nReprint 2025-26\nIndia and the Contemporary World\n38\n3  Towards Civil Disobedience\nIn February 1922, Mahatma Gandhi decided to withdraw the\nNon-Cooperation Movement. He felt the movement was turning\nviolent in many places and satyagrahis needed to be properly trained\nbefore they would be ready for mass struggles. Within the Congress,\nsome leaders were by now tired of mass struggles and wanted to\nparticipate in elections to the provincial councils that had been set\nup by the Government of India Act of 1919. They felt that it was\nimportant to oppose British policies within the councils, argue for\nreform and also demonstrate that these councils were not truly\ndemocratic. C. R. Das and Motilal Nehru formed the Swaraj Party\nwithin the Congress to argue for a return to council politics. But\nyounger leaders like Jawaharlal Nehru and Subhas Chandra Bose\npressed for more radical mass agitation and for full independence.\nIn such a situation of internal debate and dissension two factors\nagain shaped Indian politics towards the late 1920s. The first was\nthe effect of the worldwide economic depression. Agricultural prices\nbegan to fall from 1926 and collapsed after 1930. As the demand\nfor agricultural goods fell and exports declined, peasants found it\ndifficult to sell their harvests and pay their revenue. By 1930, the\ncountryside was in turmoil.\nAgainst this background the new Tory government in Britain\nconstituted a Statutory Commission under Sir John Simon. Set up\nin response to the nationalist movement, the\ncommission was to look into the functioning of\nthe constitutional system in India and suggest\nchanges. The problem was that the commission\ndid not have a single Indian member. They were\nall British.\nWhen the Simon Commission arrived in India in\n1928, it was greeted with the slogan ‘Go back\nSimon’. All parties, including the Congress and the\nMuslim League, participated in the demonstrations.\nIn an effort to win them over, the viceroy, Lord\nIrwin, announced in October 1929, a vague offer\nof ‘dominion status’ for India in an unspecified\nfuture, and a Round Table Conference to discuss a\nfuture constitution. This did not satisfy the Congress\nleaders. The radicals within the Congress, led by\nFig. 6 – Meeting of Congress leaders  at Allahabad, 1931.\nApart from Mahatma Gandhi, you can see Sardar Vallabhbhai\nPatel (extreme left), Jawaharlal Nehru (extreme right) and Subhas\nChandra Bose (fifth from right).\nLala Lajpat Rai was assaulted by the British police\nduring a peaceful demonstration against the\nSimon Commission. He succumbed to injuries\nthat were inflicted on him during the\ndemonstration.\nReprint 2025-26\n39\nNationalism  in  India\nJawaharlal Nehru and Subhas Chandra Bose, became more assertive.\nThe liberals and moderates, who were proposing a constitutional\nsystem within the framework of British dominion, gradually lost\ntheir influence. In December 1929, under the presidency of Jawaharlal\nNehru, the Lahore Congress formalised the demand of ‘Purna\nSwaraj’ or full independence for India. It was declared that 26 January\n1930, would be celebrated as the Independence Day when people\nwere to take a pledge to struggle for complete independence. But\nthe celebrations attracted very little attention. So Mahatma Gandhi\nhad to find a way to relate this abstract idea of freedom to more\nconcrete issues of everyday life.\n3.1 The Salt March and the Civil Disobedience Movement\nMahatma Gandhi found in salt a powerful symbol that could unite\nthe nation. On 31 January 1930, he sent a letter to Viceroy Irwin\nstating eleven demands. Some of these were of general interest;\nothers were specific demands of different classes, from industrialists\nto peasants. The idea was to make the demands wide-ranging, so\nthat all classes within Indian society could identify with them and\neveryone could be brought together in a united campaign. The most\nstirring of all was the demand to abolish the salt tax. Salt was\nsomething consumed by the rich and the poor alike, and it was one\nof the most essential items of food. The tax on salt and the\ngovernment monopoly over its production, Mahatma Gandhi\ndeclared, revealed the most oppressive face of British rule.\nMahatma Gandhi’s letter was, in a way, an ultimatum. If the\ndemands were not fulfilled by 11 March, the letter stated, the\nCongress would launch a civil disobedience campaign. Irwin was\nunwilling to negotiate. So Mahatma Gandhi started his famous\nsalt march accompanied by 78 of his trusted volunteers. The march\nwas over 240 miles, from Gandhiji’s ashram in Sabarmati to the\nGujarati coastal town of Dandi. The volunteers walked for 24 days,\nabout 10 miles a day. Thousands came to hear Mahatma Gandhi\nwherever he stopped, and he told them what he meant by swaraj\nand urged them to peacefully defy the British. On 6 April he reached\nDandi, and ceremonially violated the law, manufacturing salt by\nboiling sea water.\nThis marked the beginning of the Civil Disobedience Movement.\nHow was this movement different from the Non-Cooperation\nMovement? People were now asked not only to refuse cooperation\nThe Independence Day Pledge, 26 January\n1930\n‘We believe that it is the inalienable right of the\nIndian people, as of any other people, to have\nfreedom and to enjoy the fruits of their toil and\nhave the necessities of life, so that they may\nhave full opportunities of growth.

We believe, therefore,\nthat India must sever the British connection and\nattain Purna Swaraj or Complete Independence.’\nSource C\nSource\nReprint 2025-26\nIndia and the Contemporary World\n40\nwith the British, as they had done in 1921-22, but also to break\ncolonial laws. Thousands in different parts of the country broke\nthe salt law, manufactured salt and demonstrated in front of\ngovernment salt factories. As the movement spread, foreign cloth\nwas boycotted, and liquor shops were picketed. Peasants refused to\npay revenue and chaukidari taxes, village officials resigned, and in\nmany places forest people violated forest laws – going into Reserved\nForests to collect wood and graze cattle.\nWorried by the developments, the colonial government began\narresting the Congress leaders one by one. This led to violent clashes\nin many palaces. When Abdul Ghaffar Khan, a devout disciple of\nMahatma Gandhi, was arrested in April 1930, angry crowds\ndemonstrated in the streets of Peshawar, facing armoured cars and\npolice firing. Many were killed. A month later, when Mahatma\nGandhi himself was arrested, industrial workers in Sholapur attacked\npolice posts, municipal buildings, lawcourts and railway stations –\nall structures that symbolised British rule. A frightened government\nresponded with a policy of brutal repression. Peaceful satyagrahis\nwere attacked, women and children were beaten, and about 100,000\npeople were arrested.\nIn such a situation, Mahatma Gandhi once again decided to call off\nthe movement and entered into a pact with Irwin on 5 March 1931.\nBy this Gandhi-Irwin Pact, Gandhiji consented to participate in a\nRound Table Conference (the Congress had boycotted the first\nFig. 7 – The Dandi march.\nDuring the salt march Mahatma\nGandhi was accompanied by\n78 volunteers.

In December 1931, Gandhiji went to\nLondon for the conference, but the negotiations broke down and\nhe returned disappointed. Back in India, he discovered that the\ngovernment had begun a new cycle of repression. Ghaffar Khan\nand Jawaharlal Nehru were both in jail, the Congress had been\ndeclared illegal, and a series of measures had been imposed to prevent\nmeetings, demonstrations and boycotts. With great apprehension,\nMahatma Gandhi relaunched the Civil Disobedience Movement.\nFor over a year, the movement continued, but by 1934 it lost\nits momentum.\n3.2 How Participants saw the Movement\nLet us now look at the different social groups that participated in the\nCivil Disobedience Movement. Why did they join the movement?\nWhat were their ideals? What did swaraj mean to them?\nIn the countryside, rich peasant communities – like the Patidars of\nGujarat and the Jats of Uttar Pradesh – were active in the movement.\nBeing producers of commercial crops, they were very hard hit by\nthe trade depression and falling prices. As their cash income\ndisappeared, they found it impossible to pay the government’s revenue\ndemand. And the refusal of the government to reduce the revenue\ndemand led to widespread resentment. These rich peasants became\nenthusiastic supporters of the Civil Disobedience Movement,\norganising their communities, and at times forcing reluctant members,\nto participate in the boycott programmes. For them the fight for\nswaraj was a struggle against high revenues. But they were deeply\ndisappointed when the movement was called off in 1931 without\nthe revenue rates being revised. So when the movement was restarted\nin 1932, many of them refused to participate.\nThe poorer peasantry were not just interested in the lowering of the\nrevenue demand. Many of them were small tenants cultivating land\nthey had rented from landlords. As the Depression continued and\ncash incomes dwindled, the small tenants found it difficult to pay\ntheir rent. They wanted the unpaid rent to the landlord to be remitted.\nThey joined a variety of radical movements, often led by Socialists\nand Communists. Apprehensive of raising issues that might upset\nthe rich peasants and landlords, the Congress was unwilling to support\n‘no rent’ campaigns in most places. So the relationship between the\npoor peasants and the Congress remained uncertain.\n‘To the altar of this revolution we have\nbrought our youth as incense’\nMany nationalists thought that the struggle\nagainst the British could not be won through\nnon-violence. In 1928, the Hindustan Socialist\nRepublican Army (HSRA) was founded at a\nmeeting in Ferozeshah Kotla ground in Delhi.\nAmongst its leaders were Bhagat Singh, Jatin\nDas and Ajoy Ghosh. In a series of dramatic\nactions in different parts of India, the HSRA\ntargeted some of the symbols of British power.\nIn April 1929, Bhagat Singh and Batukeswar\nDutta threw a bomb in the Legislative Assembly.\nIn the same year there was an attempt to blow\nup the train that Lord Irwin was travelling in.\nBhagat Singh was 23 when he was tried and\nexecuted by the colonial government. During\nhis trial, Bhagat Singh stated that he did not\nwish to glorify ‘the cult of the bomb and pistol’\nbut wanted a revolution in society:\n‘Revolution is the inalienable right of mankind.\nFreedom is the imprescriptible birthright of all.\nThe labourer is the real sustainer of society …\nTo the altar of this revolution we have brought\nour youth as incense, for no sacrifice is too\ngreat for so magnificent a cause. We are\ncontent. We await the advent of revolution.\nInquilab Zindabad!’\nBox 1\nReprint 2025-26\nIndia and the Contemporary World\n42\nWhat about the business classes? How did they relate to the Civil\nDisobedience Movement? During the First World War, Indian\nmerchants and industrialists had made huge profits and become\npowerful (see Chapter 5). Keen on expanding their business, they\nnow reacted against colonial policies that restricted business activities.\nThey wanted protection against imports of foreign goods, and a\nrupee-sterling foreign exchange ratio that would discourage imports.\nTo organise business interests, they formed the Indian Industrial\nand Commercial Congress in 1920 and the Federation of the Indian\nChamber of Commerce and Industries (FICCI) in 1927. Led by\nprominent industrialists like Purshottamdas Thakurdas and\nG. D. Birla, the industrialists attacked colonial control over the Indian\neconomy, and supported the Civil Disobedience Movement when\nit was first launched.  They gave financial assistance and refused to\nbuy or sell imported goods. Most businessmen came to see swaraj\nas a time when colonial restrictions on business would no longer\nexist and trade and industry would flourish without constraints. But\nafter the failure of the Round Table Conference, business groups\nwere no longer uniformly enthusiastic. They were apprehensive of\nthe spread of militant activities, and worried about prolonged\ndisruption of business, as well as of the growing influence of\nsocialism amongst the younger members of the Congress.\nThe industrial working classes did not participate in the Civil\nDisobedience Movement in large numbers, except in the Nagpur\nregion. As the industrialists came closer to the Congress, workers\nstayed aloof. But in spite of that, some workers did participate in\nthe Civil Disobedience Movement, selectively adopting some of\nthe ideas of the Gandhian programme, like boycott of foreign\ngoods, as part of their own movements against low wages and\npoor working conditions. There were strikes by railway workers in\n1930 and dockworkers in 1932. In 1930 thousands of workers in\nChotanagpur tin mines wore Gandhi caps and participated in protest\nrallies and boycott campaigns. But the Congress was reluctant to\ninclude workers’ demands as part of its programme of struggle.\nIt felt that this would alienate industrialists and divide the anti-\nimperial forces.\nAnother important feature of the Civil Disobedience Movement\nwas the large-scale participation of women. During Gandhiji’s salt\nmarch, thousands of women came out of their homes to listen to\nhim. They participated in protest marches, manufactured salt, and\nSome important dates\n1918-19\nDistressed UP peasants organised by Baba\nRamchandra.\nApril 1919\nGandhian hartal against Rowlatt Act; Jallianwala\nBagh massacre.\nJanuary 1921\nNon-Cooperation and Khilafat movement\nlaunched.\nFebruary 1922\nChauri Chaura; Gandhiji withdraws Non-\nCooperation movement.\nMay 1924\nAlluri Sitarama Raju arrested ending a two-year\narmed tribal struggle.\nDecember 1929\nLahore Congress; Congress adopts the demand\nfor ‘Purna Swaraj’.\n1930\nAmbedkar establishes Depressed Classes\nAssociation.\nMarch 1930\nGandhiji begins Civil Disobedience Movement by\nbreaking salt law at Dandi.\nMarch 1931\nGandhiji ends Civil Disobedience Movement.\nDecember 1931\nSecond Round Table Conference.\n1932\nCivil Disobedience re-launched.\nReprint 2025-26\n43\nNationalism  in  India\npicketed foreign cloth and liquor shops. Many went to jail. In urban\nareas these women were from high-caste families; in rural areas\nthey came from rich peasant households. Moved by Gandhiji’s call,\nthey began to see service to the nation as a sacred duty of women.\nYet, this increased public role did not necessarily mean any radical\nchange in the way the position of women was visualised. Gandhiji\nwas convinced that it was the duty of women to look after home\nand hearth, be good mothers and good wives. And for a long time\nthe Congress was reluctant to allow women to hold any position\nof authority within the organisation. It was keen only on their\nsymbolic presence.\n3.3 The Limits of Civil Disobedience\nNot all social groups were moved by the abstract concept of swaraj.\nOne such group was the nation’s ‘untouchables’, who from around\nthe 1930s had begun to call themselves dalit or oppressed. For\nlong the Congress had ignored the dalits, for fear of offending the\nsanatanis, the conservative high-caste Hindus. But Mahatma Gandhi\ndeclared that swaraj would not come for a hundred years if\nuntouchability was not eliminated. He called the ‘untouchables’ harijan,\nWhy did various classes and groups of Indians\nparticipate in the Civil Disobedience\nMovement?\nDiscuss\nFig. 9 – Women join\nnationalist processions.\nDuring the national\nmovement, many women,\nfor the first time in their\nlives, moved out of their\nhomes on to a public arena.\nAmongst the marchers you\ncan see many old women,\nand mothers with children in\ntheir arms.\nReprint 2025-26\nIndia and the Contemporary World\n44\nor the children of God, organised satyagraha to secure them\nentry into temples, and access to public wells, tanks, roads and\nschools. He himself cleaned toilets to dignify the work of the\nbhangi (the sweepers), and persuaded upper castes to change\ntheir heart and give up ‘the sin of untouchability’. But many\ndalit leaders were keen on a different political solution to the\nproblems of the community. They began organising themselves,\ndemanding reserved seats in educational institutions, and a\nseparate electorate that would choose dalit members for\nlegislative councils. Political empowerment, they believed, would\nresolve the problems of their social disabilities. Dalit\nparticipation in the Civil Disobedience Movement was therefore\nlimited, particularly in the Maharashtra and Nagpur region\nwhere their organisation was quite strong.\nDr B.R. Ambedkar, who organised the dalits into the\nDepressed Classes Association in 1930, clashed with Mahatma\nGandhi at the second Round Table Conference by demanding\nseparate electorates for dalits. When the British government\nconceded Ambedkar’s demand, Gandhiji began a fast unto\ndeath. He believed that separate electorates for dalits would\nslow down the process of their integration into society.\nAmbedkar ultimately accepted Gandhiji’s position and the\nresult was the Poona Pact of September 1932. It gave the\nDepressed Classes (later to be known as the Schedule Castes)\nreserved seats in provincial and central legislative councils,\nbut they were to be voted in by the general electorate. The\ndalit movement, however, continued to be apprehensive of\nthe Congress-led national movement.\nSome of the Muslim political organisations in India were also\nlukewarm in their response to the Civil Disobedience\nMovement. After the decline of the Non-Cooperation-Khilafat\nMovement, a large section of Muslims felt alienated from the\nCongress. From the mid-1920s the Congress came to be more\nvisibly associated with openly Hindu religious nationalist groups\nlike the Hindu Mahasabha. As relations between Hindus and\nMuslims worsened, each community organised religious\nprocessions with militant fervour, provoking Hindu-Muslim\ncommunal clashes and riots in various cities. Every riot deepened\nthe distance between the two communities.\nThe Congress and the Muslim League made efforts to renegotiate\nan alliance, and in 1927 it appeared that such a unity could be forged.\nThe important differences were over the question of representation\nin the future assemblies that were to be elected. Muhammad Ali\nFig. 10 – Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru\nand Maulana Azad at Sevagram Ashram,\nWardha, 1935.\nReprint 2025-26\n45\nNationalism  in  India\nJinnah, one of the leaders of the Muslim League, was willing to give\nup the demand for separate electorates, if Muslims were assured\nreserved seats in the Central Assembly and representation in\nproportion to population in the Muslim-dominated provinces (Bengal\nand Punjab). Negotiations over the question of representation\ncontinued but all hope of resolving the issue at the All Parties\nConference in 1928 disappeared when M.R. Jayakar of the Hindu\nMahasabha strongly opposed efforts at compromise.\nWhen the Civil Disobedience Movement started there was thus\nan atmosphere of suspicion and distrust between communities.\nAlienated from the Congress, large sections of Muslims could not\nrespond to the call for a united struggle. Many Muslim leaders and\nintellectuals expressed their concern about the status of Muslims\nas a minority within India. They feared that the culture and identity\nof minorities would be submerged under the domination of a\nHindu majority.\nIn 1930, Sir Muhammad Iqbal, as president of the Muslim League, reiterated the importance of separate electorates for\nthe Muslims as an important safeguard for their minority political interests. His statement is supposed to have provided the\nintellectual justification for the Pakistan demand that came up in subsequent years. This is what he said:\n‘I have no hesitation in declaring that if the principle that the Indian Muslim is entitled to full and free development on the\nlines of his own culture and tradition in his own Indian home-lands is recognised as the basis of a permanent communal\nsettlement, he will be ready to stake his all for the freedom of India. The principle that each group is entitled to free\ndevelopment on its own lines is not inspired by any feeling of narrow communalism … A community which is inspired by\nfeelings of ill-will towards other communities is low and ignoble. I entertain the highest respect for the customs, laws,\nreligions and social institutions of other communities. Nay, it is my duty according to the teachings of the Quran, even to\ndefend their places of worship, if need be. Yet I love the communal group which is the source of life and behaviour and\nwhich has formed me what I am by giving me its religion, its literature, its thought, its culture and thereby its whole past\nas a living operative factor in my present consciousness …\n‘Communalism in its higher aspect, then, is indispensable to the formation of a harmonious whole in a country like India.\nThe units of Indian society are not territorial as in European countries … The principle of European democracy cannot be\napplied to India without recognising the fact of communal groups. The Muslim demand for the creation of a Muslim India\nwithin India is, therefore, perfectly justified…\n‘The Hindu thinks that separate electorates are contrary to the spirit of true nationalism, because he understands the\nword “nation” to mean a kind of universal amalgamation in which no communal entity ought to retain its private individuality.\nSuch a state of things, however, does not exist. India is a land of racial and religious variety. Add to this the general\neconomic inferiority of the Muslims, their enormous debt, especially in the Punjab, and their insufficient majorities in some\nof the provinces, as at present constituted and you will begin to see clearly the meaning of our anxiety to retain separate\nelectorates.’\nSource D\nSource\nRead the Source D carefully.

But how did the nation become a reality in the minds\nof people? How did people belonging to different communities,\nregions or language groups develop a sense of collective belonging?\nThis sense of collective belonging came partly through the experience\nof united struggles. But there were also a variety of cultural processes\nthrough which nationalism captured people’s imagination. History\nand fiction, folklore and songs, popular prints and symbols, all played\na part in the making of nationalism.\nFig. 11 – Bal Gangadhar Tilak,\nan early-twentieth-century print.\nNotice how Tilak is surrounded by symbols of\nunity. The sacred institutions of different faiths\n(temple, church, masjid) frame the central figure.\nReprint 2025-26\n47\nNationalism  in  India\nThe identity of the nation, as you know (see Chapter 1), is most\noften symbolised in a figure or image. This helps create an image\nwith which people can identify the nation. It was in the twentieth\ncentury, with the growth of nationalism, that the identity of India\ncame to be visually associated with the image of Bharat Mata. The\nimage was first created by Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay. In the\n1870s he wrote ‘Vande Mataram’ as a hymn to the motherland.\nLater it was included in his novel Anandamath and widely sung during\nthe Swadeshi movement in Bengal. Moved by the Swadeshi\nmovement, Abanindranath Tagore painted his famous image of\nBharat Mata (see Fig. 12). In this painting Bharat Mata is portrayed\nas an ascetic figure; she is calm, composed, divine and spiritual.\nIn subsequent years, the image of Bharat Mata acquired many\ndifferent forms, as it circulated in popular prints, and was painted\nby different artists (see Fig. 14). Devotion to this mother figure came\nto be seen as evidence of one’s nationalism.\nIdeas of nationalism also developed through a movement to revive\nIndian folklore.  In late-nineteenth-century India, nationalists began\nrecording folk tales sung by bards and they toured villages to gather\nfolk songs and legends. These tales, they believed, gave a true picture\nof traditional culture that had been corrupted and damaged by\noutside forces. It was essential to preserve this folk tradition  in\norder to discover one’s national identity and restore a sense of pride\nin one’s past. In Bengal, Rabindranath Tagore himself began collecting\nballads, nursery rhymes and myths, and led the movement for folk\nFig. 12 – Bharat Mata, Abanindranath Tagore,\n1905.\nNotice that the mother figure here is shown as\ndispensing learning, food and clothing.

In those days Hindus would set out on conquest and\nhoist their flags in Tartar, China and other countries; now a few soldiers from a tiny island far away are lording it over the\nland of India.’\nTarinicharan Chattopadhyay, Bharatbarsher Itihas (The History of Bharatbarsh),  vol. 1, 1858.\nSource E\nSource\nrevival. In Madras, Natesa Sastri published a massive four-volume\ncollection of Tamil folk tales, The Folklore of  Southern India. He believed\nthat folklore was national literature; it was ‘the most trustworthy\nmanifestation of people’s real thoughts and characteristics’.\nAs the national movement developed, nationalist leaders became\nmore and more aware of such icons and symbols in unifying people\nand inspiring in them a feeling of nationalism. During the Swadeshi\nmovement in Bengal, a tricolour flag (red, green and yellow) was\ndesigned. It had eight lotuses representing eight provinces of British\nIndia, and a crescent moon, representing Hindus and Muslims. By\n1921, Gandhiji had designed the Swaraj flag. It was again a tricolour\n(red, green and white) and had a spinning wheel in the centre,\nrepresenting the Gandhian ideal of self-help. Carrying the flag,\nholding it aloft, during marches became a symbol of defiance.\nAnother means of creating a feeling of nationalism was through\nreinterpretation of history. By the end of the nineteenth century\nmany Indians began feeling that to instill a sense of pride in the\nnation, Indian history had to be thought about differently. The British\nsaw Indians as backward and primitive, incapable of governing\nthemselves. In response, Indians began looking into the past to\ndiscover India’s great achievements. They wrote about the glorious\ndevelopments in ancient times when art and architecture, science\nand mathematics, religion and culture, law and philosophy, crafts\nand trade had flourished. This glorious time, in their view, was\nfollowed by a history of decline, when India was colonised. These\nnationalist histories urged the readers to take pride in India’s great\nachievements in the past and struggle to change the miserable\nconditions of life under British rule.\nThese efforts to unify people were not without problems. When the\npast being glorified was Hindu, when the images celebrated were\ndrawn from Hindu iconography, then people of other communities\nfelt left out.\nFig. 14a – Bharat Mata.\nThis figure of Bharat Mata is a contrast to the\none painted by Abanindranath Tagore.

The Congress under the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi\ntried to channel people’s grievances into organised movements\nfor independence. Through such movements the nationalists\ntried to forge a national unity. But as we have seen, diverse groups\nand classes participated in these movements with varied aspirations\nand expectations. As their\ngrievances were wide-ranging,\nfreedom from colonial rule also\nmeant different things to\ndifferent people. The Congress\ncontinuously attempted to\nresolve differences, and ensure\nthat the demands of one group\ndid not alienate another. This is\nprecisely why the unity within\nthe movement often broke down.\nThe high points of Congress\nactivity and nationalist unity\nwere followed by phases of\ndisunity and inner conflict\nbetween groups.\nIn other words, what was emerging was a nation with many\nvoices wanting freedom from colonial rule.\nQuit India Movement\nThe failure of the Cripps Mission and the effects of World War II created widespread discontentment in India. This\nled Gandhiji to launch a movement calling for complete withdrawal of the British from India. The Congress Working\nCommittee, in its meeting in Wardha on 14 July 1942, passed the historic ‘Quit India’ resolution demanding the\nimmediate transfer of power to Indians and quit India. On 8 August 1942 in Bombay, the All India Congress Committee\nendorsed the resolution which called for a non-violent mass struggle on the widest possible scale throughout the\ncountry. It was on this occasion that Gandhiji delivered the famous ‘Do or Die’ speech. The call for ‘Quit India’ almost\nbrought the state machinery to a standstill in large parts of the country as people voluntarily threw themselves into\nthe thick of the movement. People observed hartals, and demonstrations and processions were accompanied by\nnational songs and slogans. The movement was truly a mass movement which brought into its ambit thousands of\nordinary people, namely students, workers and peasants. It also saw the active participation of leaders, namely,\nJayprakash Narayan, Aruna Asaf Ali and Ram Manohar Lohia and many women such as Matangini Hazra in Bengal,\nKanaklata Barua in Assam and Rama Devi in Odisha. The British responded with much force, yet it took more than a\nyear to suppress the movement.\nFig. 14b\nWomen’s procession in Bombay during the Quit\nIndia Movement\nReprint 2025-26\nIndia and the Contemporary World\n50\nDiscuss\nProject\n1.\nList all the different social groups which joined the Non-Cooperation Movement of 1921.\nThen choose any three and write about their hopes and struggles to show why they\njoined the movement.\n2.\nDiscuss the Salt March to make clear why it was an effective symbol of resistance\nagainst colonialism.\n3.\nImagine you are a woman participating in the Civil Disobedience Movement.

The first print (Fig. 1) of the\nseries, shows the peoples of Europe and America – men and women\nof all ages and social classes – marching in a long train, and offering\nhomage to the statue of Liberty as they pass by it. As you would\nrecall, artists of the time of the French Revolution personified Liberty\nas a female figure – here you can recognise the torch of Enlightenment\nshe bears in one hand and the Charter of the Rights of Man in the\nother. On the earth in the foreground of the image lie the shattered\nremains of the symbols of absolutist institutions. In Sorrieu’s\nutopian vision, the peoples of the world are grouped as distinct\nnations, identified through their flags and national costume. Leading\nthe procession, way past the statue of Liberty, are the United States\nand Switzerland, which by this time were already nation-states.

Interestingly, at the time when Sorrieu created this\nimage, the German peoples did not yet exist as a united nation – the\nflag they carry is an expression of liberal hopes in 1848 to unify the\nnumerous German-speaking principalities into a nation-state under\na democratic constitution. Following the German peoples are the\npeoples of Austria, the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, Lombardy,\nPoland, England, Ireland, Hungary and Russia. From the heavens\nabove, Christ, saints and angels gaze upon the scene. They have\nbeen used by the artist to symbolise fraternity among the nations of\nthe world.\nThis chapter will deal with many of the issues visualised by Sorrieu\nin Fig. 1. During the nineteenth century, nationalism emerged as a\nforce which brought about sweeping changes in the political and\nmental world of Europe. The end result of these changes was the\nemergence of the nation-state in place of the multi-national dynastic\nempires of Europe. The concept and practices of a modern state, in\nwhich a centralised power exercised sovereign control over a clearly\ndefined territory, had been developing over a long period of time\nin Europe. But a nation-state was one in which the majority of its\ncitizens, and not only its rulers, came to develop a sense of common\nidentity and shared history or descent. This commonness did not\nexist from time immemorial; it was forged through struggles, through\nthe actions of leaders and the common people. This chapter will\nlook at the diverse processes through which nation-states and\nnationalism came into being in nineteenth-century Europe.\nErnst Renan, ‘What is a Nation?’\nIn a lecture delivered at the University of\nSorbonne in 1882, the French philosopher Ernst\nRenan (1823-92) outlined his understanding of\nwhat makes a nation. The lecture  was\nsubsequently published as a famous essay entitled\n‘Qu’est-ce qu’une nation?’ (‘What is a Nation?’).\nIn this essay Renan criticises the notion suggested\nby others that a nation is formed by a common\nlanguage, race, religion, or territory:\n‘A nation is the culmination of a long past of\nendeavours, sacrifice and devotion. A heroic past,\ngreat men, glory, that is the social capital upon\nwhich one bases a national idea. To have\ncommon glories in the past, to have a common\nwill in the present, to have performed great deeds\ntogether, to wish to perform still more, these\nare the essential conditions of being a people. A\nnation is therefore a large-scale solidarity … Its\nexistence is a daily plebiscite … A province is its\ninhabitants; if anyone has the right to be\nconsulted, it is the inhabitant. A nation never\nhas any real interest in annexing or holding on to\na country against its will. The existence of nations\nis a good thing, a necessity even. Their existence\nis a guarantee of liberty, which would be lost if\nthe world had only one law and only one master.’\nSource\nSource A\nSummarise the attributes of a nation, as Renan\nunderstands them.

France, as you\nwould remember, was a full-fledged territorial state\nin 1789 under the rule of an absolute monarch.\nThe political and constitutional changes that came\nin the wake of the French Revolution led to the\ntransfer of sovereignty from the monarchy to a\nbody of French citizens. The revolution proclaimed\nthat it was the people who would henceforth\nconstitute the nation and shape its destiny.\nFrom the very beginning, the French revolutionaries\nintroduced various measures and practices that\ncould create a sense of collective identity amongst\nthe French people. The ideas of la patrie (the\nfatherland) and le citoyen (the citizen) emphasised\nthe notion of a united community enjoying equal rights under a\nconstitution. A new French flag, the tricolour,   was chosen to replace\nthe former royal standard. The Estates General  was elected by the\nbody of active citizens and renamed the National Assembly. New\nhymns were composed, oaths taken and martyrs commemorated,\nall in the name of the nation. A centralised administrative system\nwas put in place and it formulated uniform laws for all citizens\nwithin its territory. Internal customs duties and dues were abolished\nand a uniform system of weights and measures was adopted.\nRegional dialects were discouraged and French, as it was spoken\nand written in Paris, became the common language of the nation.\nThe revolutionaries further declared that it was the mission and the\ndestiny of the French nation to liberate the peoples of Europe\nfrom despotism, in other words to help other peoples of Europe\nto become nations.\nWhen the news of the events in France reached the different cities\nof Europe, students and other members of educated middle classes\nbegan setting up Jacobin clubs. Their activities and campaigns\nprepared the way for the French armies which moved into Holland,\nBelgium, Switzerland and much of Italy in the 1790s. With the\noutbreak of the revolutionary wars, the French armies began to\ncarry the idea of nationalism abroad.\nFig. 2 — The cover of a German almanac\ndesigned by the journalist Andreas Rebmann in\n1798.\nThe image of the French Bastille being stormed\nby the revolutionary crowd has been placed\nnext to a similar fortress meant to represent the\nbastion of despotic rule in the German province\nof Kassel. Accompanying the illustration is the\nslogan: ‘The people must seize their own\nfreedom!’ Rebmann lived in the  city of Mainz\nand was  a member of a German Jacobin group.\nReprint 2025-26\nIndia and the Contemporary World\n6\nWithin the wide swathe of territory that came under his control,\nNapoleon set about introducing many of the reforms that he had\nalready introduced in France. Through a return to monarchy\nNapoleon had, no doubt, destroyed democracy in France, but in\nthe administrative field he had incorporated revolutionary principles\nin order to make the whole system more rational and efficient. The\nCivil Code of 1804 – usually known as the Napoleonic Code –\ndid away with all privileges based on birth, established  equality\nbefore the law and secured  the right to property. This Code was\nexported to the regions under French control. In the Dutch Republic,\nin Switzerland, in Italy and Germany, Napoleon simplified\nadministrative divisions, abolished the feudal system and freed\npeasants from serfdom and manorial dues. In the towns too, guild\nrestrictions were removed. Transport and communication systems\nwere improved. Peasants, artisans, workers and new businessmen\nFig. 3 — Europe after the\nCongress of Vienna, 1815.\nICELAND\n(DENMARK)\nNORWAY\n(SWEDEN)\nSWEDEN\nDENMARK\nHABOVER\n(G.B.)\nNETHERLANDS\nENGLAND\nWALES\nIRELAND\nGREAT\nBRITAIN\nSCOTLAND\nFRANCE\nSPAIN\nPORTUGAL\nMOROCCO\nALGERIA\nTUNIS\nEGYPT\nPALESTINE\nSYRIA\nCYPRUS\nMESOPOTAMIA\nARMENIA\nOTTOMAN EMPIRE\nCRETE\nGREECE\nBULGARIA\nROMANIA\nSERBIA\nHUNGARY\nAUSTRIAN EMPIRE\nAUSTRIA\nGALICIA\nBAVARIA\nSWITZERLAND\nPRUSSIA\nPOLAND\nRUSSIAN EMPIRE\nSARDINIA\nCORSICA\nSMALL\nSTATES\nKINGDOM\nOF  THE\nTWO\nSICILIES\nGEORGIA\nPERSIA\nMEDITERRANEAN SEA\nATLANTIC  SEA\nReprint 2025-26\n7\nNationalism   in   Europe\nenjoyed a new-found freedom. Businessmen and small-scale\nproducers of goods, in particular, began to realise that uniform\nlaws, standardised weights and measures, and a common national\ncurrency would facilitate the movement and exchange of goods\nand capital from one region to another.\nHowever, in the areas conquered, the reactions of the local\npopulations to French rule were mixed. Initially, in many places such\nas Holland and Switzerland, as well as in certain cities like Brussels,\nMainz, Milan and Warsaw, the French armies were welcomed as\nharbingers of liberty. But the initial enthusiasm soon turned to hostility,\nas it became clear that the new administrative arrangements did not\ngo hand in hand with political freedom. Increased taxation,\ncensorship, forced conscription into the French armies required to\nconquer the rest of Europe, all seemed to outweigh the advantages\nof the administrative changes.\nFig. 4 — The Planting of Tree of Liberty in Zweibrücken, Germany.\nThe subject of this colour print by the German painter Karl Kaspar Fritz is the occupation of the town of Zweibrücken\nby the French armies. French soldiers, recognisable by their blue, white and red uniforms, have been portrayed as\noppressors as they seize a peasant’s cart (left), harass some young women (centre foreground) and force a peasant\ndown to his knees. The plaque being affixed to the Tree of Liberty carries a German inscription which in translation\nreads: ‘Take freedom and equality from us, the model of humanity.’ This is a sarcastic reference to the claim of the\nFrench as being liberators who opposed monarchy in the territories they entered.\nFig. 5 — The courier of Rhineland loses all that\nhe has on his way home from Leipzig.\nNapoleon here is represented as a postman on\nhis way back to France after he lost the battle of\nLeipzig in 1813. Each letter dropping out of his\nbag bears the names of the territories he lost.\nReprint 2025-26\nIndia and the Contemporary World\n8\nIf you look at the map of mid-eighteenth-century Europe you will\nfind that there were no ‘nation-states’ as we know them today.\nWhat we know today as Germany, Italy and Switzerland were\ndivided into kingdoms, duchies and cantons whose rulers had their\nautonomous territories. Eastern and Central Europe were under\nautocratic monarchies within the territories of which lived diverse\npeoples. They did not see themselves as sharing a collective identity\nor a common culture. Often, they even spoke different languages\nand belonged to different ethnic groups. The Habsburg Empire\nthat ruled over Austria-Hungary, for example, was a patchwork of\nmany different regions and peoples. It included the Alpine regions\n– the Tyrol, Austria and the Sudetenland – as well as Bohemia,\nwhere the aristocracy was predominantly German-speaking. It also\nincluded the Italian-speaking provinces of Lombardy and Venetia.\nIn Hungary, half of the population spoke Magyar while the other\nhalf spoke a variety of dialects. In Galicia, the aristocracy spoke\nPolish. Besides these three dominant groups, there also lived within\nthe boundaries of the empire, a mass of subject peasant peoples –\nBohemians and Slovaks to the north, Slovenes in Carniola, Croats\nto the south, and Roumans to the east in Transylvania. Such\ndifferences did not easily promote a sense of political unity. The\nonly tie binding these diverse groups together was a common\nallegiance to the emperor.\nHow did nationalism and the idea of the nation-state emerge?\n2.1 The Aristocracy and the New Middle Class\nSocially and politically, a landed aristocracy was the dominant class\non the continent. The members of this class were united by a\ncommon way of life that cut across regional divisions. They owned\nestates in the countryside and also town-houses. They spoke French\nfor purposes of diplomacy and in high society. Their families were\noften connected by ties of marriage. This powerful aristocracy was,\nhowever, numerically a small group. The majority of the population\nwas made up of the peasantry. To the west, the bulk of the land\nwas farmed by tenants and small owners, while in Eastern and\nCentral Europe the pattern of landholding was characterised by\nvast estates which were cultivated by serfs.\n2  The Making of Nationalism in Europe\nSome important dates\n1797\nNapoleon invades Italy; Napoleonic wars\nbegin.\n1814-1815\nFall of Napoleon; the Vienna Peace\nSettlement.\n1821\nGreek struggle for independence begins.\n1848\nRevolutions in Europe; artisans, industrial\nworkers and peasants revolt against\neconomic hardships; middle classes\ndemand constitutions and representative\ngovernments; Italians, Germans, Magyars,\nPoles, Czechs, etc. demand nation-states.\n1859-1870\n Unification of Italy.\n1866-1871\nUnification of Germany.\n1905\nSlav nationalism gathers force in the\nHabsburg and Ottoman Empires.\nReprint 2025-26\n9\nNationalism   in   Europe\nIn Western and parts of Central Europe the growth of industrial\nproduction and trade meant the growth of towns and the emergence\nof commercial classes whose existence was based on production\nfor the market. Industrialisation began in England in the second\nhalf of the eighteenth century, but in France and parts of the German\nstates it occurred only during the nineteenth century. In its wake,\nnew social groups came into being: a working-class population, and\nmiddle classes made up of industrialists, businessmen, professionals.\nIn Central and Eastern Europe these groups were smaller in number\ntill late nineteenth century. It was among the educated, liberal middle\nclasses that ideas of national unity following the abolition of\naristocratic privileges gained popularity.\n2.2 What did Liberal Nationalism Stand for?\nIdeas of national unity in early-nineteenth-century Europe were closely\nallied to the ideology of liberalism. The term ‘liberalism’ derives\nfrom the Latin root liber, meaning free. For the new middle classes\nliberalism stood for freedom for the individual and equality of all\nbefore the law. Politically, it emphasised the concept of government\nby consent. Since the French Revolution, liberalism had stood for\nthe end of autocracy and clerical privileges, a constitution and\nrepresentative government through parliament. Nineteenth-century\nliberals also stressed the inviolability of private property.\nYet, equality before the law did not necessarily stand for universal\nsuffrage. You will recall that in revolutionary France, which marked\nthe first political experiment in liberal democracy, the right to vote\nand to get elected was granted exclusively to property-owning men.\nMen without property and all women were excluded from political\nrights. Only for a brief period under the Jacobins did all adult males\nenjoy suffrage. However, the Napoleonic Code went back to limited\nsuffrage and reduced women to the status of a minor, subject to\nthe authority of fathers and husbands. Throughout the nineteenth\nand early twentieth centuries women and non-propertied men\norganised opposition movements demanding equal political rights.\nIn the economic sphere, liberalism stood for the freedom of markets\nand the abolition of state-imposed restrictions on the movement\nof goods and capital. During the nineteenth century this was a strong\ndemand of the emerging middle classes. Let us take the example of\nthe German-speaking regions in the first half of the nineteenth\ncentury. Napoleon’s administrative measures had created out of\nNew words\nSuffrage – The right to vote\nReprint 2025-26\nIndia and the Contemporary World\n10\ncountless small principalities a confederation of 39 states. Each of\nthese possessed its own currency, and weights and measures. A\nmerchant travelling in 1833 from Hamburg to Nuremberg to sell\nhis goods would have had to pass through 11 customs barriers and\npay a customs duty of about 5 per cent at each one of them. Duties\nwere often levied according to the weight or measurement of the\ngoods. As each region had its own system of weights and measures,\nthis involved time-consuming calculation. The measure of cloth,\nfor example, was the elle  which in each region stood for a different\nlength. An elle of textile material bought in Frankfurt would get you\n54.7 cm of cloth, in Mainz 55.1 cm, in Nuremberg 65.6 cm, in\nFreiburg 53.5 cm.\nSuch conditions were viewed as obstacles to economic exchange\nand growth by the new commercial classes, who argued for the\ncreation of a unified economic territory allowing the unhindered\nmovement of goods, people and capital.  In 1834, a customs union\nor zollverein was formed at the initiative of Prussia and joined by\nmost of the German states. The union abolished tariff barriers and\nreduced the number of currencies from over thirty to two. The\ncreation of a network of railways further stimulated mobility,\nharnessing economic interests to national unification. A wave of\neconomic nationalism strengthened the wider nationalist sentiments\ngrowing at the time.\n2.3 A New Conservatism after 1815\nFollowing the defeat of Napoleon in 1815, European governments\nwere driven by a spirit of conservatism. Conservatives believed\nthat established, traditional institutions of state and society –  like the\nmonarchy, the Church, social hierarchies, property and the family –\nshould be preserved. Most conservatives, however, did not propose\na return to the society of pre-revolutionary days. Rather, they realised,\nfrom the changes initiated by Napoleon, that modernisation could\nin fact strengthen traditional institutions like the monarchy. It could\nmake  state  power more effective and strong. A modern army, an\nefficient bureaucracy, a dynamic economy, the abolition of feudalism\nand serfdom could strengthen the autocratic monarchies of Europe.\nIn 1815, representatives of the European powers – Britain, Russia,\nPrussia and Austria – who had collectively defeated Napoleon, met\nat Vienna to draw up a settlement for Europe. The Congress was\nhosted by the Austrian Chancellor Duke Metternich. The delegates\nEconomists began to think in terms of the national\neconomy. They talked of how the nation could\ndevelop and what economic measures could help\nforge this nation together.\nFriedrich List, Professor of Economics at the\nUniversity of Tübingen in Germany, wrote in 1834:\n‘The aim of the zollverein is to bind the Germans\neconomically into a nation. It will strengthen the\nnation materially as much by protecting its\ninterests externally as by stimulating its internal\nproductivity. It ought to awaken and raise\nnational sentiment through a fusion of individual\nand provincial interests. The German people have\nrealised that a free economic system is the only\nmeans to engender national feeling.’\nSource\nSource B\nDescribe the political ends that List hopes to\nachieve through economic measures.\nDiscuss\nNew words\nConservatism – A political philosophy that\nstressed the importance of tradition, established\ninstitutions and customs, and preferred gradual\ndevelopment to quick change\nReprint 2025-26\n11\nNationalism   in   Europe\ndrew up the Treaty of Vienna of 1815 with the object of undoing\nmost of the changes that had come about in Europe during the\nNapoleonic wars. The Bourbon dynasty, which had been deposed\nduring the French Revolution, was restored to power, and France\nlost the territories it had annexed under Napoleon. A series of states\nwere set up on the boundaries of France to prevent French expansion\nin future. Thus the kingdom of the Netherlands, which included\nBelgium, was set up in the north and Genoa was added to Piedmont\nin the south. Prussia was given important new territories on its western\nfrontiers, while Austria was given control of northern Italy. But the\nGerman confederation of 39 states that had been set up by Napoleon\nwas left untouched. In the east, Russia was given part of Poland\nwhile Prussia was given a portion of Saxony. The main intention\nwas to restore the monarchies that had been overthrown by\nNapoleon, and create a new conservative order in Europe.\nConservative regimes set up in 1815 were autocratic. They did not\ntolerate criticism and dissent, and sought to curb activities that\nquestioned the legitimacy of autocratic governments.  Most of them\nimposed censorship laws to control what was said in newspapers,\nbooks, plays and songs and reflected the ideas of liberty and freedom\nPlot on a map of Europe the changes drawn\nup by the Vienna Congress.\nActivity\nFig. 6 — The Club of Thinkers, anonymous caricature dating to c. 1820.\nThe plaque on the left bears the inscription: ‘The most important question of today’s meeting: How\nlong will thinking be allowed to us?’\nThe board on the right lists the rules of the Club which include the following:\n‘1.

The memory of the French\nRevolution nonetheless continued to inspire liberals. One of the major\nissues taken up by the liberal-nationalists, who criticised the new\nconservative order, was freedom of the press.\n2.4 The Revolutionaries\nDuring the years following 1815, the fear of repression drove\nmany liberal-nationalists underground. Secret societies sprang\nup in many European states to train revolutionaries and spread\ntheir ideas. To be revolutionary at this time meant a commitment\nto oppose monarchical forms that had been established after\nthe Vienna Congress, and to fight for liberty and freedom. Most\nof these revolutionaries also saw the creation of nation-states as\na necessary part of this struggle for freedom.\nOne such individual was the Italian revolutionary Giuseppe\nMazzini. Born in Genoa in 1805, he became a member of the\nsecret society of the Carbonari. As a young man of 24, he was\nsent into exile in 1831 for attempting a revolution in Liguria.\nHe subsequently founded two more underground societies,\nfirst, Young Italy in Marseilles, and then, Young Europe in\nBerne, whose members were like-minded young men from\nPoland, France, Italy and the German states. Mazzini believed\nthat God had intended nations to be the natural units of\nmankind. So Italy could not continue to be a patchwork of\nsmall states and kingdoms. It had to be forged into a single\nunified republic within a wider alliance of nations. This\nunification alone could be the basis of Italian liberty. Following\nhis model, secret societies were set up in Germany, France,\nSwitzerland and Poland. Mazzini’s relentless opposition to\nmonarchy and his vision of democratic republics frightened the\nconservatives.  Metternich described him as ‘the most dangerous\nenemy of our social order’.\nFig. 7 — Giuseppe Mazzini and the founding of\nYoung Europe in Berne 1833.\nPrint by Giacomo Mantegazza.\nReprint 2025-26\n13\nNationalism   in   Europe\n3  The Age of Revolutions: 1830-1848\nAs conservative regimes tried to consolidate their power, liberalism\nand nationalism came to be increasingly associated with revolution\nin many regions of Europe such as the Italian and German states,\nthe provinces of the Ottoman Empire, Ireland and Poland. These\nrevolutions were led by the liberal-nationalists belonging to the\neducated middle-class elite, among whom were professors, school-\nteachers, clerks and members of the commercial middle classes.\nThe first upheaval took place in France in July 1830.  The Bourbon\nkings who had been restored to power during the conservative\nreaction after 1815, were now overthrown by liberal revolutionaries\nwho installed a constitutional monarchy with Louis Philippe at its\nhead. ‘When France sneezes,’ Metternich once remarked, ‘the rest of\nEurope catches cold.’  The July Revolution sparked an uprising in\nBrussels which led to Belgium breaking away from the United\nKingdom of the Netherlands.\nAn event that mobilised nationalist feelings among the educated elite\nacross Europe was the Greek war of independence. Greece had\nbeen part of the Ottoman Empire since the fifteenth century. The\ngrowth of revolutionary nationalism in Europe sparked off a struggle\nfor independence amongst the Greeks which began in 1821.\nNationalists in Greece got support from other Greeks living in exile\nand also from many West Europeans who had sympathies for ancient\nGreek culture. Poets and artists lauded Greece as the cradle of\nEuropean civilisation and mobilised public opinion to support its\nstruggle against a Muslim empire. The English poet Lord Byron\norganised funds and later went to fight in the war, where he died of\nfever in 1824. Finally, the Treaty of Constantinople of 1832\nrecognised Greece as an independent nation.\n3.1 The Romantic Imagination and National Feeling\nThe development of nationalism did not come about only through\nwars and territorial expansion. Culture played an important role in\ncreating the idea of the nation: art and poetry, stories and music\nhelped express and shape nationalist feelings.\nLet us look at Romanticism, a cultural movement which sought to\ndevelop a particular form of nationalist sentiment. Romantic artists\nand poets generally criticised the glorification of reason and science\nReprint 2025-26\nIndia and the Contemporary World\n14\nFig. 8 — The Massacre at Chios, Eugene Delacroix, 1824.\nThe French painter Delacroix was one of the most important French Romantic\npainters. This huge painting (4.19m x 3.54m) depicts an incident in which\n20,000 Greeks were said to have been killed by Turks on the island of Chios. By\ndramatising the incident, focusing on the suffering of women and children, and\nusing vivid colours, Delacroix sought to appeal to the emotions of the spectators,\nand create sympathy for the Greeks.\nand focused instead on emotions, intuition and mystical feelings.\nTheir effort was to create a sense of a shared collective heritage, a\ncommon cultural past, as the basis of a nation.\nOther Romantics such as the German philosopher Johann Gottfried\nHerder (1744-1803) claimed that true German culture was to be\ndiscovered among the common people – das volk. It was through\nfolk songs, folk poetry and folk dances that the true spirit of the\nnation (volksgeist) was popularised. So collecting and recording these\nforms of folk culture was essential to the project of nation-building.\nReprint 2025-26\n15\nNationalism   in   Europe\nThe Grimm Brothers: Folktales and\nNation-building\nGrimms’ Fairy Tales is a familiar name. The brothers\nJacob and Wilhelm Grimm were born in the\nGerman city of Hanau in 1785 and 1786\nrespectively. While both of them studied law,\nthey soon developed an interest in collecting old\nfolktales. They spent six years travelling from\nvillage to village, talking to people and writing\ndown fairy tales, which were handed down\nthrough the generations. These were popular\nboth among children and adults. In 1812, they\npublished their first collection of tales.\nSubsequently, both the brothers became active\nin liberal politics, especially the movement\nfor freedom of the press. In the meantime they\nalso published a 33-volume dictionary of the\nGerman language.\nThe Grimm brothers also saw French domination\nas a threat to German culture, and believed that\nthe folktales they had collected were expressions\nof a pure and authentic German spirit. They\nconsidered their projects of collecting folktales\nand developing the German language as part of\nthe wider effort to oppose French domination\nand create a German national identity.\nThe emphasis on vernacular language and the collection of local\nfolklore was not just to recover an ancient national spirit, but also to\ncarry the modern nationalist message to large audiences who were\nmostly illiterate. This was especially so in the case of Poland, which\nhad been partitioned at the end of the eighteenth century by the\nGreat Powers – Russia, Prussia and Austria. Even though Poland no\nlonger existed as an independent territory, national feelings were kept\nalive through music and language. Karol Kurpinski, for example,\ncelebrated the national struggle through his operas and music, turning\nfolk dances like the polonaise and mazurka into nationalist symbols.\nLanguage too played an important role in developing nationalist\nsentiments. After Russian occupation, the Polish language was forced\nout of schools and the Russian language was imposed everywhere.\nIn 1831, an armed rebellion against Russian rule took place which\nwas ultimately crushed. Following this, many members of the clergy\nin Poland began to use language as a weapon of national resistance.\nPolish was used for Church gatherings and all religious instruction.\nAs a result, a large number of priests and bishops were put in jail or\nsent to Siberia by the Russian authorities as punishment for their\nrefusal to preach in Russian. The use of Polish came to be seen as a\nsymbol of the struggle against Russian dominance.\n3.2 Hunger, Hardship and Popular Revolt\nThe 1830s were years of great economic hardship in Europe. The\nfirst half of the nineteenth century saw an enormous increase in\npopulation all over Europe. In most countries there were more\nseekers of jobs than employment. Population from rural areas\nmigrated to the cities to live in overcrowded slums. Small producers\nin towns were often faced with stiff competition from imports of\ncheap machine-made goods from England, where industrialisation\nwas more advanced than on the continent. This was especially so in\ntextile production, which was carried out mainly in homes or small\nworkshops and was only partly mechanised. In those regions of\nEurope where the aristocracy still enjoyed power, peasants struggled\nunder the burden of feudal dues and obligations. The rise of food\nprices or a year of bad harvest led to widespread pauperism in\ntown and country.\nThe year 1848 was one such year. Food shortages and widespread\nunemployment brought the population of Paris out on the roads.\nBarricades were erected and Louis Philippe was forced to flee.

National\nworkshops to provide employment were set up.\nEarlier, in 1845, weavers in Silesia had led a revolt against contractors\nwho supplied them raw material and gave them orders for finished\ntextiles but drastically reduced their payments. The journalist Wilhelm\nWolff described the events in a Silesian village as follows:\nIn these villages (with 18,000 inhabitants) cotton weaving is the\nmost widespread occupation … The misery of the workers is\nextreme. The desperate need for jobs has been taken advantage\nof by the contractors to reduce the prices of the goods they\norder …\nOn 4 June at 2 p.m. a large crowd of weavers emerged from\ntheir homes and marched in pairs up to the mansion of their\ncontractor demanding higher wages. They were treated with\nscorn and threats alternately. Following this, a group of them\nforced their way into the house, smashed its elegant window-\npanes, furniture, porcelain … another group broke into the\nstorehouse and plundered it of supplies of cloth which they\ntore to shreds … The contractor fled with his family to a\nneighbouring village which, however, refused to shelter such a\nperson. He returned 24 hours later having requisitioned the army.\nIn the exchange that followed, eleven weavers were shot.\nFig. 9 — Peasants’ uprising, 1848.\nDescribe the cause of the Silesian weavers’\nuprising.

Events of February\n1848 in France had brought about the abdication of the monarch\nand a republic based on universal male suffrage had been proclaimed.\nIn other parts of Europe where independent nation-states did not\nyet exist – such as Germany, Italy, Poland, the Austro-Hungarian\nEmpire – men and women of the liberal middle classes combined\ntheir demands for constitutionalism with national unification. They\ntook advantage of the growing popular unrest to push their\ndemands for the creation of a nation-state on parliamentary\nprinciples – a constitution, freedom of the press and freedom\nof association.\nIn the German regions a large number of political associations whose\nmembers were middle-class professionals, businessmen and\nprosperous artisans came together in the city of Frankfurt and decided\nto vote for an all-German National Assembly. On 18 May 1848,\n831 elected representatives marched in a festive procession to take\ntheir places in the Frankfurt parliament convened in the Church of\nSt Paul. They drafted a constitution for a German nation to be\nheaded by a monarchy subject to a parliament. When the deputies\noffered the crown on these terms to Friedrich Wilhelm IV, King of\nPrussia, he rejected it and joined other monarchs to oppose the\nelected assembly. While the opposition of the aristocracy and military\nbecame stronger, the social basis of parliament eroded. The\nparliament was dominated by the middle classes who resisted the\ndemands of workers and artisans and consequently lost their support.\nIn the end troops were called in and the assembly was forced\nto disband.\nThe issue of extending political rights to women was a controversial\none within the liberal movement, in which large numbers of women\nhad participated actively over the years. Women had formed their\nown political associations, founded newspapers and taken part in\npolitical meetings and demonstrations. Despite this they were denied\nHow were liberty and equality for women\nto be defined?\nThe liberal politician Carl Welcker, an elected\nmember of the Frankfurt Parliament, expressed\nthe following views:\n‘Nature has created men and women to carry\nout different functions … Man, the stronger, the\nbolder and freer of the two, has been designated\nas protector of the family, its provider, meant for\npublic tasks in the domain of law, production,\ndefence. Woman, the weaker, dependent and\ntimid, requires the protection of man. Her sphere\nis the home, the care of the children, the\nnurturing of the family … Do we require any\nfurther proof that given such differences, equality\nbetween the sexes would only endanger\nharmony and destroy the dignity of the family?’\nLouise Otto-Peters (1819-95) was a political\nactivist who founded a women’s journal and\nsubsequently a feminist political association. The\nfirst issue of her newspaper (21 April 1849) carried\nthe following editorial:\n‘Let us ask how many men, possessed by\nthoughts of living and dying for the sake of Liberty,\nwould be prepared to fight for the freedom of\nthe entire people, of all human beings? When\nasked this question, they would all too easily\nrespond with a “Yes!”, though their untiring\nefforts are intended for the benefit of only one\nhalf of humanity – men. But Liberty is indivisible!\nFree men therefore must not tolerate to be\nsurrounded by the unfree …’\nAn anonymous reader of the same newspaper\nsent the following letter to the editor on 25 June\n1850:\n‘It is indeed ridiculous and unreasonable to deny\nwomen political rights even though they enjoy\nthe right to property which they make use\nof. They perform functions and assume\nresponsibilities without however getting the\nbenefits that accrue to men for the same … Why\nthis injustice? Is it not a disgrace that even the\nstupidest cattle-herder possesses the right\nto vote, simply because he is a man, whereas\nhighly talented women owning considerable\nproperty are excluded from this right, even\nthough they contribute so much to the\nmaintenance of the state?’ Source\nSource C\nNew words\nFeminist – Awareness of women’s rights and interests based on\nthe belief of the social, economic and political equality of the genders\nReprint 2025-26\nIndia and the Contemporary World\n18\nFig. 10 — The Frankfurt parliament in the Church of St Paul.\nContemporary colour print.

Monarchs were\nbeginning to realise that the cycles of revolution and repression could\nonly be ended by granting concessions to the liberal-nationalist\nrevolutionaries. Hence, in the years after 1848, the autocratic\nmonarchies of Central and Eastern Europe began to introduce the\nchanges that had already taken place in Western Europe before 1815.\nThus serfdom and bonded labour were abolished both in the\nHabsburg dominions and in Russia. The Habsburg rulers granted\nmore autonomy to the Hungarians in 1867.\nReprint 2025-26\n19\nNationalism   in   Europe\n4  The Making of Germany and Italy\n4.1 Germany – Can the Army be the Architect of a Nation?\nAfter 1848, nationalism in Europe moved away from its association\nwith democracy and revolution. Nationalist sentiments were often\nmobilised by conservatives for promoting state power and achieving\npolitical domination over Europe.\nThis can be observed in the process by which Germany and Italy came\nto be unified as nation-states. As you have seen, nationalist feelings were\nwidespread among middle-class Germans, who in 1848 tried to unite\nthe different regions of the German confederation into a nation-state\ngoverned by an elected parliament. This liberal initiative to nation-building\nwas, however, repressed by the combined forces of the monarchy and\nthe military, supported by the large landowners (called Junkers) of Prussia.\nFrom then on, Prussia took on the leadership of the movement for\nnational unification. Its chief minister, Otto von\nBismarck, was the architect of this process carried\nout with the help of the Prussian army and\nbureaucracy. Three wars over seven years – with\nAustria, Denmark and France – ended in Prussian\nvictory and completed the process of unification.\nIn January 1871, the Prussian king, William I,\nwas proclaimed German Emperor in a ceremony\nheld at Versailles.\nOn the bitterly cold morning of 18 January 1871,\nan assembly comprising the princes of the\nGerman states, representatives of the army,\nimportant Prussian ministers including the chief\nminister Otto von Bismarck gathered in the\nunheated Hall of Mirrors in the Palace of Versailles\nto proclaim the new German Empire headed\nby Kaiser William I of Prussia.\nThe nation-building process in Germany had\ndemonstrated the dominance of Prussian state\npower. The new state placed a strong emphasis\non modernising the currency, banking, legal\nand judicial systems in Germany. Prussian\nmeasures and practices often became a model for\nthe rest of Germany.\nFig. 11 — The proclamation of the German empire in the Hall of\nMirrors at Versailles, Anton von Werner.

During the middle of the\nnineteenth century, Italy was divided into seven states, of which\nonly one, Sardinia-Piedmont, was ruled by an Italian princely house.\nThe north was under Austrian Habsburgs, the centre was ruled by\nthe Pope and the southern regions were under the domination\nof the Bourbon kings of Spain. Even the Italian language had\nnot acquired one common form and still had many regional and\nlocal variations.\nDuring the 1830s, Giuseppe Mazzini had sought to put together a\ncoherent programme for a unitary Italian Republic. He had also\nformed a secret society called Young Italy for the dissemination of\nhis goals. The failure of revolutionary uprisings both in 1831 and\n1848 meant that the mantle now fell on Sardinia-Piedmont under\nits ruler King Victor Emmanuel II to unify the Italian states through\nwar. In the eyes of the ruling elites of this region, a unified\nItaly offered them the possibility of economic development and\npolitical dominance.\nFig. 13 — Caricature of Otto von Bismarck in\nthe German reichstag (parliament), from Figaro,\nVienna, 5 March 1870.\nDescribe the caricature.

Like many\nother wealthy and educated members of the Italian elite, he spoke\nFrench much better than he did Italian. Through a tactful diplomatic\nalliance with France engineered by Cavour, Sardinia-Piedmont\nsucceeded in defeating the Austrian forces in 1859. Apart from regular\ntroops, a large number of armed volunteers under the leadership of\nGiuseppe Garibaldi joined the fray. In 1860, they marched into South\nItaly and the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies and succeeded in winning\nthe support of the local peasants in order to drive out the Spanish\nrulers. In 1861 Victor Emmanuel II was proclaimed king of united\nItaly. However, much of the Italian population, among whom rates\nof illiteracy were very high, remained blissfully unaware of liberal-\nnationalist ideology. The peasant masses who had supported Garibaldi\nin southern Italy had never heard of Italia, and believed that ‘La  Talia’\nwas Victor Emmanuel’s wife!\nFig. 14(a) — Italian states before unification, 1858.\nFig. 14(b) — Italy after unification.\nThe map shows the year in which different\nregions (seen in Fig 14(a) become part of a\nunified Italy.\nSWITZERLAND\nVENETIA\nLOMBARDY\nSAVOY\nSARDINIA\nPARMA\nMODENA\nTUSCANY\nSAN MARINO\nPAPAL\nSTATE\nKINGDOM\nOF BOTH\nSICILIES\nTUNIS\nMONACO\n1858\n1858-60\n1860\n1866\n1870\nSWITZERLAND\nTUNIS\n4.3  The Strange Case of Britain\nThe model of the nation or the nation-state, some scholars have\nargued, is Great Britain.

It was the\nresult of a long-drawn-out process. There was no British nation\nprior to the eighteenth century. The primary identities of the people\nwho inhabited the British Isles were ethnic ones – such as English,\nWelsh, Scot or Irish. All of these ethnic groups had their own cultural\nand political traditions. But as the English nation steadily grew in\nwealth, importance and power, it was able to extend its influence\nover the other nations of the islands. The English parliament, which\nhad seized power from the monarchy in 1688 at the end of a\nprotracted conflict, was the instrument through which a nation-state,\nwith England at its centre, came to be forged. The Act of Union\n(1707) between England and Scotland that resulted in the formation\nof the ‘United Kingdom of Great Britain’ meant, in effect, that\nEngland was able to impose its influence on Scotland. The British\nparliament was henceforth dominated by its English members. The\ngrowth of a British identity meant that Scotland’s distinctive culture\nand political institutions were systematically suppressed. The Catholic\nclans that inhabited the Scottish Highlands suffered terrible repression\nwhenever they attempted to assert their independence. The Scottish\nHighlanders were forbidden to speak their Gaelic language or\nwear their national dress, and large numbers were forcibly driven\nout of their homeland.\nIreland suffered a similar fate. It was a country deeply divided\nbetween Catholics and Protestants. The English helped the Protestants\nof Ireland to establish their dominance over a largely Catholic country.\nCatholic revolts against British dominance were suppressed. After a\nfailed revolt led by Wolfe Tone and his United Irishmen (1798),\nIreland was forcibly incorporated into the United Kingdom in 1801.\nA new ‘British nation’ was forged through the propagation of a\ndominant English culture. The symbols of the new Britain – the\nBritish flag (Union Jack), the national anthem (God Save Our Noble\nKing), the English language – were actively promoted and the older\nnations survived only as subordinate partners in this union.\nNew words\nEthnic – Relates to a common racial, tribal, or\ncultural origin or background that a community\nidentifies with or claims\nThe artist has portrayed Garibaldi as holding on to the base of\nthe boot, so that the King of Sardinia-Piedmont can enter it from\nthe top.

He\ncame from a family engaged in coastal trade and\nwas a sailor in the merchant navy. In 1833 he\nmet Mazzini, joined the Young Italy movement\nand participated in a republican uprising in\nPiedmont in 1834. The uprising was suppressed\nand Garibaldi had to flee to South America, where\nhe lived in exile till 1848. In 1854, he supported\nVictor Emmanuel II in his efforts to unify the\nItalian states. In 1860, Garibaldi led the famous\nExpedition of the Thousand to South Italy. Fresh\nvolunteers kept joining through the course of\nthe campaign, till their numbers grew to about\n30,000. They were popularly known as Red\nShirts.\nIn 1867, Garibaldi led an army of volunteers to\nRome to fight the last obstacle to the unification\nof Italy, the Papal States where a French garrison\nwas stationed. The Red Shirts proved to be no\nmatch for the combined French and Papal troops.\nIt was only in 1870 when, during the war with\nPrussia, France withdrew its troops from Rome\nthat the Papal States were finally joined\nto Italy.\nBox 2\nFig. 15 – Garibaldi helping King Victor\nEmmanuel II of Sardinia-Piedmont to pull on the\nboot named ‘Italy’.

Artists in\nthe eighteenth and nineteenth centuries found a way out by\npersonifying a nation. In other words they represented a country as\nif it were a person. Nations were then portrayed as female figures.\nThe female form that was chosen to personify the nation did not\nstand for any particular woman in real life; rather it sought to give\nthe abstract idea of the nation a concrete form. That is, the female\nfigure became an allegory of the nation.\nYou will recall that during the French Revolution artists used the\nfemale allegory to portray ideas such as Liberty, Justice and the\nRepublic. These ideals were represented through specific objects or\nsymbols.  As you would remember, the attributes of Liberty are the\nred cap, or the broken chain, while Justice is generally a blindfolded\nwoman carrying a pair of weighing scales.\nSimilar female allegories were invented by artists in the nineteenth\ncentury to represent the nation. In France she was christened\nMarianne, a popular Christian name, which underlined the idea of a\npeople’s nation. Her characteristics were drawn from those of Liberty\nand the Republic – the red cap, the tricolour, the cockade. Statues\nof Marianne were erected in public squares to remind the public of\nthe national symbol of unity and to persuade them to identify with\nit. Marianne images were marked on coins and stamps.\nSimilarly, Germania became the allegory of the German nation. In\nvisual representations, Germania wears a crown of oak leaves, as\nthe German oak stands for heroism.\nNew words\nAllegory – When an abstract idea (for instance, greed, envy,\nfreedom, liberty) is expressed through a person or a thing.

During\nthis period nationalist groups became increasingly intolerant of each\nother and ever ready to go to war. The major European powers, in\nturn, manipulated the nationalist aspirations of the subject peoples\nin Europe to further their own imperialist aims.\nThe most serious source of nationalist tension in Europe after 1871\nwas the area called the Balkans. The Balkans was a region of\ngeographical and ethnic variation comprising modern-day Romania,\nBulgaria, Albania, Greece, Macedonia, Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina,\nSlovenia, Serbia and Montenegro whose inhabitants were broadly\nknown as the Slavs. A large part of the Balkans was under the control\nof the Ottoman Empire. The spread of the ideas of romantic\nnationalism in the Balkans together with the disintegration of the\nOttoman Empire made this region very explosive. All through the\nnineteenth century the Ottoman Empire had sought to strengthen\nitself through modernisation and internal reforms but with very\nlittle success. One by one, its European subject nationalities broke\naway from its control and declared independence. The Balkan\npeoples based their claims for independence or political rights on\nnationality and used history to prove that they had once been\nindependent but had subsequently been subjugated by foreign\npowers. Hence the rebellious nationalities in the Balkans thought of\ntheir struggles as attempts to win back their long-lost independence.\n As the different Slavic nationalities struggled to define their identity\nand independence, the Balkan area became an area of intense conflict.\nThe Balkan states were fiercely jealous of each other and each hoped\nto gain more territory at the expense of the others. Matters were\nfurther complicated because the Balkans also became the scene of\nbig power rivalry. During this period, there was intense rivalry among\nthe European powers over trade and colonies as well as naval and\nmilitary might. These rivalries were very evident in the way the Balkan\nproblem unfolded. Each power – Russia, Germany, England,\nAustro-Hungary – was keen on countering the hold of other powers\nover the Balkans, and extending its own control over the area. This\nled to a series of wars in the region and finally the First World War.\nReprint 2025-26\n27\nNationalism   in   Europe\nNationalism, aligned with imperialism, led Europe to disaster in 1914.\nBut meanwhile, many countries in the world which had been\ncolonised by the European powers in the nineteenth century began\nto oppose imperial domination. The anti-imperial movements that\ndeveloped everywhere were nationalist, in the sense that they all\nstruggled to form independent nation-states, and were inspired by\na sense of collective national unity, forged in confrontation with\nimperialism. European ideas of nationalism were nowhere\nreplicated, for people everywhere developed their own specific variety\nof nationalism. But the idea that societies should be organised into\n‘nation-states’ came to be accepted as natural and universal.\nFig. 20 — A map celebrating the British Empire.\nAt the top, angels are shown carrying the banner of freedom.

We read printed\nliterature, see printed images, follow the news through newspapers,\nand track public debates that appear in print. We take for granted\nthis world of print and often forget that there was a time before\nprint. We may not realise that print itself has a history which has, in\nfact, shaped our contemporary world. What is this history? When\ndid printed literature begin to circulate? How has it helped create\nthe modern world?\nIn this chapter we will look at the development of print, from its\nbeginnings in East Asia to its expansion in Europe and in India. We\nwill understand the impact of the spread of technology and consider\nhow social lives and cultures changed with the coming of print.\nPrint  Culture   a n d  the  Modern  World\nChapter V\nPrint Culture and the Modern World\nFig. 1 – Book making before the age of print, from\nAkhlaq-i-Nasiri, 1595.\nThis is a royal workshop in the sixteenth century,\nmuch before printing began in India.

This was a system of hand printing. From AD 594\nonwards, books in China were printed by rubbing paper – also\ninvented there – against the inked surface of woodblocks. As both\nsides of the thin, porous sheet could not be printed, the traditional\nChinese ‘accordion book’ was folded and stitched at the side.\nSuperbly skilled craftsmen could duplicate, with remarkable accuracy,\nthe beauty of calligraphy.\nThe imperial state in China was, for a very long time, the major\nproducer of printed material. China possessed a huge bureaucratic\nsystem which recruited its personnel through civil service\nexaminations. Textbooks for this examination were printed in vast\nnumbers under the sponsorship of the imperial state.  From the\nsixteenth century, the number of examination candidates went up\nand that increased the volume of print.\nBy the seventeenth century, as urban culture bloomed in China, the\nuses of print diversified. Print was no longer used just by scholar-\nofficials. Merchants used print in their everyday life, as they collected\ntrade information. Reading increasingly became a leisure activity.\nThe new readership preferred fictional narratives, poetry,\nautobiographies, anthologies of literary masterpieces, and romantic\nplays. Rich women began to read, and many women began\npublishing their poetry and plays. Wives of scholar-officials published\ntheir works and courtesans wrote about their lives.\nThis new reading culture was accompanied by a new technology.\nWestern printing techniques and mechanical presses were imported\nin the late nineteenth century as Western powers established their\noutposts in China. Shanghai became the hub of the new print culture,\ncatering to the Western-style schools. From hand printing there was\nnow a gradual shift to mechanical printing.\n1.1 Print in Japan\nBuddhist missionaries from China introduced hand-printing\ntechnology into Japan around AD 768-770. The oldest Japanese book,\nprinted in AD 868, is the Buddhist Diamond Sutra, containing six sheets\nof text and woodcut illustrations. Pictures were printed on textiles,\nNew words\nCalligraphy – The art of beautiful and stylised\nwriting\nReprint 2025-26\n107\nPrint   Culture\nplaying cards and paper money. In\nmedieval Japan, poets and prose\nwriters were regularly published,\nand books were cheap and abundant.\nPrinting of visual material led to\ninteresting publishing practices. In\nthe late eighteenth century, in the\nflourishing urban circles at Edo\n(later to be known as Tokyo),\nillustrated collections of paintings\ndepicted an elegant urban culture, involving artists, courtesans,\nand teahouse gatherings. Libraries and bookstores were packed\nwith hand-printed material of various types – books on women,\nmusical instruments, calculations, tea ceremony, flower\narrangements, proper etiquette, cooking and famous places.\nBox 1\nKitagawa Utamaro, born in Edo in 1753, was widely known for\nhis contributions to an art form called ukiyo (‘pictures of the floating\nworld’) or depiction of ordinary human experiences, especially urban\nones. These prints travelled to contemporary US and Europe and\ninfluenced artists like Manet, Monet and Van Gogh. Publishers like\nTsutaya Juzaburo identified subjects and commissioned artists who\ndrew the theme in outline. Then a skilled woodblock carver pasted\nthe drawing on a woodblock and carved a printing block to\nreproduce the painter’s lines. In the process, the original drawing\nwould be destroyed and only prints would survive.\nFig. 3 – An ukiyo\nprint by Kitagawa\nUtamaro.\nBelonging to the mid-13th\ncentury, printing woodblocks of\nthe Tripitaka Koreana are a Korean\ncollection of Buddhist scriptures.\nThey were engraved on about\n80,000 woodblocks.

In the eleventh century, Chinese paper reached Europe\nvia the same route. Paper made possible the production of\nmanuscripts, carefully written by scribes. Then, in 1295, Marco Polo,\na great explorer, returned to Italy after many years of exploration in\nChina. As you read above, China already had the technology of\nwoodblock printing. Marco Polo brought this knowledge back with\nhim. Now Italians began producing books with woodblocks, and\nsoon the technology spread to other parts of Europe. Luxury\neditions were still handwritten on very expensive vellum, meant for\naristocratic circles and rich monastic libraries which scoffed at printed\nbooks as cheap vulgarities. Merchants and students in the university\ntowns bought the cheaper printed copies.\nAs the demand for books increased, booksellers all over Europe\nbegan exporting books to many different countries. Book fairs were\nheld at different places. Production of handwritten manuscripts was\nalso organised in new ways to meet the expanded demand. Scribes\nor skilled handwriters were no longer solely employed by wealthy\nor influential patrons but increasingly by booksellers as well. More\nthan 50 scribes often worked for one bookseller.\nBut the production of handwritten manuscripts could not satisfy\nthe ever-increasing demand for books. Copying was an expensive,\nlaborious and time-consuming business. Manuscripts were fragile,\nawkward to handle, and could not be carried around or read easily.\nTheir circulation therefore remained limited.  With the growing\ndemand for books, woodblock printing gradually became more\nand more popular. By the early fifteenth century, woodblocks were\nbeing widely used in Europe to print textiles, playing cards, and\nreligious pictures with simple, brief texts.\nThere was clearly a great need for even quicker and cheaper\nreproduction of texts. This could only be with the invention of a\nnew print technology. The breakthrough occurred at Strasbourg,\nGermany, where Johann Gutenberg developed the first-known\nprinting press in the 1430s.\nImagine that you are Marco Polo.

At one time it used to be a wooden board; later it\nwas made of  steel\n2.1 Gutenberg and the Printing Press\nGutenberg was the son of a merchant and grew up on a large\nagricultural estate. From his childhood he had seen wine and olive\npresses. Subsequently, he learnt the art of polishing stones, became a\nmaster goldsmith, and also acquired the expertise to create lead\nmoulds used for making trinkets. Drawing on this knowledge,\nGutenberg adapted existing technology to design his innovation.\nThe olive press provided the model for the printing press, and moulds\nwere used for casting the metal types for the letters of the alphabet.\nBy 1448, Gutenberg perfected the system. The first book he printed\nwas the Bible. About 180 copies were printed and it took three\nyears to produce them. By the standards of the time this was fast\nproduction.\nThe new technology did not entirely displace the existing art of\nproducing books by hand.\nIn fact, printed books at first closely resembled the written\nmanuscripts in appearance and layout. The metal letters imitated the\nornamental handwritten styles. Borders were illuminated by hand\nwith foliage and other patterns, and illustrations were painted. In the\nbooks printed for the rich, space for decoration was kept blank on\nthe printed page. Each purchaser could choose the design and decide\non the painting school that would do the illustrations.\nIn the hundred years between 1450 and 1550, printing presses were\nset up in most countries of Europe.  Printers from Germany travelled\nto other countries, seeking work and helping start new presses. As\nthe number of printing presses grew, book production boomed.\nThe second half of the fifteenth century saw 20 million copies of\nprinted books flooding the markets in Europe. The number went\nup in the sixteenth century to about 200 million copies.\nThis shift from hand printing to mechanical printing led to the\nprint revolution.\nFig. 6  – Gutenberg Printing Press.\nNotice the long handle attached to the screw.\nThis handle was used to turn the screw and\npress down the platen over the printing block\nthat was placed on top of a sheet of damp\npaper. Gutenberg developed metal types for\neach of the 26 characters of the Roman\nalphabet and devised a way of moving them\naround so as to compose different words of the\ntext. This came to be known as the moveable\ntype printing machine, and it remained the basic\nprint technology over the next 300 years.\nBooks could now be produced much faster than\nwas possible when each print block was\nprepared by carving a piece of wood by hand.\nThe Gutenberg  press could print 250 sheets\non one side per hour.\nFig. 5 – A Portrait  of\nJohann Gutenberg,\n1584.\nPrinting block\nplaced over\npaper\nFrame\nScrew\nHandle\nPlaten\nReprint 2025-26\nIndia and the Contemporary World\n110\nFig. 7 – Pages of Gutenberg’s Bible, the first printed book in Europe.\nGutenberg printed about 180 copies, of which no more than 50 have\nsurvived.\nLook at these pages of Gutenberg’s Bible carefully. They were not just\nproducts of new technology. The text was printed in the new Gutenberg\npress with metal type, but the borders were carefully designed, painted and\nilluminated by hand by artists. No two copies were the same. Every page of\neach copy was different. Even when two copies look similar, a careful\ncomparison will reveal differences. Elites everywhere preferred this lack of\nuniformity: what they possessed then could be claimed as unique, for no\none else owned a copy that was exactly the same.\nIn the text you will notice the use of colour within the letters in various\nplaces. This had two functions: it added colour to the page, and highlighted\nall the holy words to emphasise their significance. But the colour on every\npage of the text was added by hand. Gutenberg printed the text in black,\nleaving spaces where the colour could be filled in later.\nNew words\nCompositor – The person who composes the\ntext for printing\nGalley – Metal frame in which types are laid\nand the text composed\nFig. 8 –  A printer’s workshop, sixteenth century.\nThis picture depicts what a printer’s shop looked like in the\nsixteenth century.

It was not just a development, a new\nway of producing books; it  transformed the lives of people,\nchanging their relationship to information and knowledge, and with\ninstitutions and authorities. It influenced popular perceptions and\nopened up new ways of looking at things.\nLet us explore some of these changes.\n3.1 A New Reading Public\nWith the printing press, a new reading public emerged. Printing\nreduced the cost of books. The time and labour required to produce\neach book came down, and multiple copies could be produced\nwith greater ease. Books flooded the market, reaching out to an\never-growing readership.\nAccess to books created a new culture of reading. Earlier, reading\nwas restricted to the elites. Common people lived in a world of oral\nculture. They heard sacred texts read out, ballads recited, and folk\ntales narrated. Knowledge was transferred orally. People collectively\nheard a story, or saw a performance. As you will see in Chapter 8,\nthey did not read a book individually and silently. Before the age of\nprint, books were not only expensive but they could not be produced\nin sufficient numbers. Now books could reach out to wider sections\nof people. If earlier there was a hearing public, now a reading public\ncame into being.\nBut the transition was not so simple. Books could be read only by\nthe literate, and the rates of literacy in most European countries\nwere very low till the twentieth century. How, then, could publishers\npersuade the common people to welcome the printed book? To do\nthis, they had to keep in mind the wider reach of the printed work:\neven those who did not read could certainly enjoy listening to books\nbeing read out. So printers began publishing popular ballads and\nfolk tales, and such books would be profusely illustrated with pictures.\nThese were then sung and recited at gatherings in villages and in\ntaverns in towns.\nOral culture thus entered print and printed material was orally\ntransmitted. The line that separated the oral and reading cultures\nbecame blurred. And the hearing public and reading public became\nintermingled.\nNew words\nBallad – A historical account or folk tale in\nverse, usually sung or recited\nTaverns – Places where people gathered to\ndrink alcohol, to be served food, and to meet\nfriends and exchange news\nYou are a bookseller advertising the availability\nof new cheap printed books.

Martin Luther was one\nof the main Protestant reformers. Several\ntraditions of anti-Catholic Christianity\ndeveloped out of the movement\n3.2 Religious Debates and the Fear of Print\nPrint created the possibility of wide circulation of\nideas, and introduced a new world of debate and\ndiscussion. Even those who disagreed with\nestablished authorities could now print and circulate\ntheir ideas. Through the printed message, they could\npersuade people to think differently, and move them\nto action. This had significance in different spheres\nof life.\nNot everyone welcomed the printed book, and those\nwho did also had fears about it. Many were\napprehensive of the effects that the easier access to\nthe printed word and the wider circulation of books,\ncould have on people’s minds. It was feared that if\nthere was no control over what was printed and\nread then rebellious and irreligious thoughts might\nspread. If that happened the authority of ‘valuable’\nliterature would be destroyed. Expressed by religious\nauthorities and monarchs, as well as many writers\nand artists, this anxiety was the basis of widespread\ncriticism of the new printed literature that had begun\nto circulate.\nLet us consider the implication of this in one sphere\nof life in early modern Europe – namely,  religion.\nIn 1517, the religious reformer Martin Luther wrote\nNinety Five Theses criticising many of the practices\nand rituals of the Roman Catholic Church.  A printed\ncopy of this was posted on a church door in Wittenberg. It challenged\nthe Church to debate his ideas.  Luther’s writings were immediately\nreproduced in vast numbers and read widely. This lead to a division\nwithin the Church and to the beginning of the Protestant\nReformation. Luther’s translation of the New Testament sold 5,000\ncopies within a few weeks and a second edition appeared within\nthree months. Deeply grateful to print, Luther said, ‘Printing is the\nultimate gift of God and the greatest one.’ Several scholars, in fact,\nthink that print brought about a new intellectual atmosphere and\nhelped spread the new ideas that led to the Reformation.\nFig. 9 – J.V. Schley, L’Imprimerie, 1739.\nThis is one of the many images produced in early modern\nEurope, celebrating the coming of print. You can see the\nprinting press descending from heaven, carried by a goddess.\nOn two sides of the goddess, blessing the machine, are\nMinerva (the goddess of wisdom) and Mercury (the messenger\ngod, also symbolising reason).

In the sixteenth century, Menocchio, a miller in Italy, began\nto read books that were available in his locality. He reinterpreted the\nmessage of the Bible and formulated a view of God and Creation\nthat enraged the Roman Catholic Church. When the Roman Church\nbegan its inquisition to repress heretical ideas, Menocchio was hauled\nup twice and ultimately executed. The Roman Church, troubled by\nsuch effects of popular readings and questionings of faith, imposed\nsevere controls over publishers and booksellers and began to maintain\nan Index of Prohibited Books from 1558.\nNew words\nInquisition – A former Roman Catholic court\nfor identifying and punishing heretics\nHeretical – Beliefs which do not follow the\naccepted teachings of the Church.

He wrote in Adages (1508):\n‘To what corner of the world do they not fly,\nthese swarms of new books? It may be that one\nhere and there contributes something worth\nknowing, but the very multitude of them is hurtful\nto scholarship, because it creates a glut, and even\nin good things satiety is most harmful ... [printers]\nfill the world with books, not just trifling things\n(such as I write, perhaps), but stupid, ignorant,\nslanderous, scandalous, raving, irreligious and\nseditious books, and the number of them\nis such that even the valuable publications lose\ntheir value.’\nSource\nSource A\nFig. 10 – The macabre dance.\nThis sixteenth-century print shows how the fear of printing was\ndramatised in visual representations of the time.

Churches of different denominations\nset up schools in villages, carrying literacy to peasants and artisans.\nBy the end of the eighteenth century, in some parts of Europe\nliteracy rates were as high as 60 to 80 per cent. As literacy and schools\nspread in European countries, there was a virtual reading mania.\nPeople wanted books to read and printers produced books in ever-\nincreasing numbers.\nNew forms of popular literature appeared in print, targeting new\naudiences. Booksellers employed pedlars who roamed around\nvillages, carrying little books for sale. There were almanacs or ritual\ncalendars, along with ballads and folktales. But other forms of reading\nmatter, largely for entertainment, began to reach ordinary readers as\nwell. In England, penny chapbooks were carried by petty pedlars\nknown as chapmen, and sold for a penny, so that even the poor\ncould buy them. In France, were the “Biliotheque Bleue”, which\nwere low-priced small books printed on poor quality paper, and\nbound in cheap blue covers. Then there were the romances, printed\non four to six pages, and the more substantial ‘histories’ which were\nstories about the past. Books were of various sizes, serving many\ndifferent purposes and interests.\nThe periodical press developed from the early eighteenth century,\ncombining information about current affairs with entertainment.\nNewspapers and journals carried information about wars and trade,\nas well as news of developments in other places.\nSimilarly, the ideas of scientists and philosophers now became more\naccessible to the common people. Ancient and medieval scientific\ntexts were compiled and published, and maps and scientific diagrams\nwere widely printed. When scientists like Isaac Newton began to\npublish their discoveries, they could influence a much wider circle\nof scientifically minded readers. The writings of thinkers such as\nThomas Paine, Voltaire and Jean Jacques Rousseau were also widely\nprinted and read. Thus their ideas about science, reason and rationality\nfound their way into popular literature.\nNew words\nDenominations – Sub groups within a religion\nAlmanac – An annual publication giving\nastronomical data, information about the\nmovements of the sun and moon, timing of\nfull tides and eclipses, and much else that was\nof importance in the everyday life of people\nChapbook – A term used to describe pocket-\nsize books that are sold by travelling pedlars\ncalled chapmen. These became popular from\nthe time of the sixteenth-century print revolution\nBox 2\nIn 1791, a London publisher, James Lackington,\nwrote in his diary:\n‘The sale of books in general has increased\nprodigiously within the last twenty years. The\npoorer sort of farmers and even the poor country\npeople in general who before that period spent\ntheir winter evenings in relating stories of witches,\nghosts, hobgoblins … now shorten the winter\nnight by hearing their sons and daughters read\nthem tales, romances, etc. If John goes to town\nwith a load of hay, he is charged to be sure not\nto forget to bring home Peregrine Pickle’s\nAdventure … and when Dolly is sent to sell her\neggs, she is commissioned to purchase The\nHistory of Joseph Andrews.’\nReprint 2025-26\n115\nPrint   Culture\n4.1 ‘Tremble, therefore, tyrants of the world!’\nBy the mid-eighteenth century, there was a common conviction that\nbooks were a means of spreading progress and enlightenment. Many\nbelieved that books could change the world,  liberate society from\ndespotism and tyranny, and herald a time when reason and intellect\nwould rule. Louise-Sebastien Mercier, a novelist in eighteenth-century\nFrance, declared: ‘The printing press is the most powerful engine of\nprogress and public opinion is the force that will sweep despotism\naway.’ In many of Mercier’s novels, the heroes are transformed by\nacts of reading. They devour books, are lost in the world books\ncreate, and become enlightened in the process.  Convinced of the\npower of print in bringing enlightenment and destroying the basis\nof despotism, Mercier proclaimed: ‘Tremble, therefore, tyrants of\nthe world! Tremble before the virtual writer!’\n4.2 Print Culture and the French Revolution\nMany historians have argued that print culture created the conditions\nwithin which French Revolution occurred. Can we make such\na connection?\nThree types of arguments have been usually put forward.\nFirst: print popularised the ideas of the Enlightenment thinkers.\nCollectively, their writings provided a critical commentary on tradition,\nsuperstition and despotism. They argued for the rule of reason rather\nthan custom, and demanded that everything be judged through the\napplication of reason and rationality. They attacked the sacred\nauthority of the Church and the despotic power of the state, thus\neroding the legitimacy of a social order based on tradition. The\nwritings of Voltaire and Rousseau were read widely; and those who\nread these books saw the world through new eyes, eyes that were\nquestioning, critical and rational.\nSecond: print created a new culture of dialogue and debate. All\nvalues, norms and institutions were re-evaluated and discussed by a\npublic that had become aware of the power of reason, and\nrecognised the need to question existing ideas and beliefs. Within\nthis public culture, new ideas of social revolution came into being.\nThird: by the 1780s there was an outpouring of literature that mocked\nthe royalty and criticised their morality. In the process, it raised\nThis is how Mercier describes the impact of the\nprinted word, and the power of reading in one\nof his books:\n‘Anyone who had seen me reading would have\ncompared me to a man dying of thirst who was\ngulping down some fresh, pure water … Lighting\nmy lamp with extraordinary caution, I threw\nmyself hungrily into the reading. An easy\neloquence, effortless and animated, carried me\nfrom one page to the next without my noticing\nit. A clock struck off the hours in the silence of\nthe shadows, and I heard nothing. My lamp began\nto run out of oil and produced only a pale light,\nbut still I read on. I could not even take out time\nto raise the wick for fear of interrupting my\npleasure. How those new ideas rushed into my\nbrain! How my intelligence adopted them!’\nQuoted by Robert Darnton, The Forbidden Best-\nSellers of Pre-Revolutionary France, 1995.\nSource\nSource B\nNew words\nDespotism – A system of governance in which\nabsolute power is exercised by an individual,\nunregulated by legal and constitutional checks\nReprint 2025-26\nIndia and the Contemporary World\n116\nWhy do some historians think that print culture created the basis for the French Revolution?\nDiscuss\nquestions about the existing social order. Cartoons and caricatures\ntypically suggested that the monarchy remained absorbed only in\nsensual pleasures while the common people suffered  immense\nhardships. This literature circulated underground and led to the\ngrowth of hostile sentiments against the monarchy.\nHow do we look at these arguments?  There can be no doubt that\nprint helps the spread of ideas. But we must remember that people\ndid not read just one kind of literature. If they read the ideas of\nVoltaire and Rousseau, they were also exposed to monarchical and\nChurch propaganda. They were not influenced directly by everything\nthey read or saw. They accepted some ideas and rejected others.\nThey interpreted things their own way. Print did not directly shape\ntheir minds, but it did open up the possibility of thinking differently.\nFig. 11 – The nobility and the common people before the French Revolution, a\ncartoon of the late eighteenth century.\nThe cartoon shows how the ordinary people – peasants, artisans and workers – had a\nhard time while the nobility enjoyed life and oppressed them.

Production of school textbooks became critical\nfor the publishing industry. A children’s press, devoted to\nliterature for children alone, was set up in France in 1857.\nThis press published new works as well as old fairy tales\nand folk tales. The Grimm Brothers in Germany spent years\ncompiling traditional folk tales gathered from peasants. What\nthey collected was edited before the stories were published\nin a collection in 1812.  Anything  that was considered\nunsuitable for children or would appear vulgar to the elites,\nwas not included in the  published version.  Rural folk tales\nthus acquired a new form. In this way, print recorded old\ntales but also changed them.\nWomen became important as readers as well as writers. Penny\nmagazines (see Fig. 12) were especially meant for women, as\nwere manuals teaching proper behaviour and housekeeping.\nWhen novels began to be written in the nineteenth century,\nwomen were seen as important readers. Some of the best-\nknown novelists were women: Jane Austen, the Bronte sisters,\nGeorge Eliot. Their writings became important in defining a new\ntype of woman:  a person with will, strength of personality,\ndetermination and the power to think.\nLending libraries had been in existence from the seventeenth century\nonwards. In the nineteenth century, lending libraries in England\nbecame instruments for educating white-collar workers, artisans\nand lower-middle-class people. Sometimes, self-educated working\nclass people wrote for themselves. After the working day was\ngradually shortened from the mid-nineteenth century, workers had\nsome time for self-improvement and self-expression. They wrote\npolitical tracts and autobiographies in large numbers.\nThomas Wood, a Yorkshire mechanic, narrated\nhow he would rent old newspapers and read\nthem by firelight in the evenings as he could not\nafford candles. Autobiographies of poor people\nnarrated their struggles to read against grim\nobstacles: the twentieth-century Russian\nrevolutionary author Maxim Gorky’s My Childhood\nand My University provide glimpses of such\nstruggles.\nFig. 12 – Frontispiece of Penny Magazine.\nPenny Magazine was published between 1832 and 1835\nin England by the Society for the Diffusion of Useful\nKnowledge. It was aimed primarily at the working class.\nReprint 2025-26\nIndia and the Contemporary World\n118\n5.2 Further Innovations\nBy the late eighteenth century, the press came to be made out of\nmetal. Through the nineteenth century, there were a series of further\ninnovations in printing technology. By the mid-nineteenth century,\nRichard M. Hoe of New York had perfected the power-driven\ncylindrical press. This was capable of printing 8,000 sheets per hour.\nThis press was particularly useful for printing newspapers.  In the\nlate nineteenth century, the offset press was developed which could\nprint up to six colours at a time. From the turn of the twentieth\ncentury, electrically operated presses accelerated printing operations.\nA series of other developments followed. Methods of feeding paper\nimproved, the quality of plates became better, automatic paper reels\nand photoelectric controls of the colour register were introduced.\nThe accumulation of several individual mechanical improvements\ntransformed the appearance of printed texts.\nPrinters and publishers continuously developed new strategies\nto sell their product. Nineteenth-century periodicals serialised\nimportant novels, which gave birth to a particular way of writing\nnovels.  In the 1920s in England, popular works were sold in\ncheap series, called the Shilling Series. The dust cover or the\nbook jacket is also a twentieth-century innovation. With the\nonset of the Great Depression in the 1930s, publishers feared a\ndecline in book purchases. To sustain buying, they brought\nout cheap paperback editions.\nLook at Fig. 13. What impact do such\nadvertisements have on the public mind?\nDo you think everyone reacts to printed material\nin the same way?\nActivity\nFig. 13 – Advertisements at a railway station in England, a lithograph by Alfred Concanen, 1874.\nPrinted advertisements and notices were plastered on street walls, railway platforms and public buildings.\nReprint 2025-26\n119\nPrint   Culture\n6  India and the World of Print\nLet us see when printing began in India and how ideas and information\nwere written before the age of print.\n6.1 Manuscripts Before the Age of Print\nIndia had a very rich and old tradition of handwritten manuscripts –\nin Sanskrit, Arabic, Persian, as well as in various vernacular languages.\nManuscripts were copied on palm leaves or on handmade paper.\nPages were sometimes beautifully illustrated. They would be either\npressed between wooden covers or sewn together to ensure\npreservation. Manuscripts continued to be produced till well after\nthe introduction of print, down to the late nineteenth century.\nManuscripts, however, were highly expensive and fragile. They had\nto be handled carefully, and they  could not be read easily as the\nFig. 15 – Pages from the Diwan of Hafiz, 1824.\nHafiz was a fourteenth-century poet whose collected works are known as Diwan.

This manuscript was produced in the eighteenth\ncentury in the Malayalam script.\nscript was written in different styles. So\nmanuscripts were not widely used in\neveryday life. Even though pre-colonial\nBengal had developed an extensive network\nof village primary schools, students very\noften did not read texts. They only learnt\nto write. Teachers dictated portions of\ntexts from memory and students wrote\nthem down. Many thus became literate\nwithout ever actually reading any kinds\nof texts.\n6.2 Print Comes to India\nThe printing press first came to Goa with Portuguese missionaries\nin the mid-sixteenth century. Jesuit priests learnt Konkani and\nprinted several tracts. By 1674, about 50 books had been printed\nin the Konkani and in Kanara languages. Catholic priests printed\nthe first Tamil book in 1579 at Cochin, and in 1713 the first\nMalayalam book was printed by them. By 1710, Dutch Protestant\nmissionaries had printed 32 Tamil texts, many of them translations\nof older works.\nThe English language press did not grow in India till quite late even\nthough the English East India Company began to import presses\nfrom the late seventeenth century.\nFrom 1780, James Augustus Hickey began to edit the Bengal Gazette,\na weekly magazine that described itself as ‘a commercial paper open\nto all, but influenced by none’. So it was private English enterprise,\nproud of its independence from colonial influence, that began English\nprinting in India. Hickey published a lot of advertisements, including\nthose that related to the import and sale of slaves. But he also\npublished a lot of gossip about the Company’s senior officials in\nIndia. Enraged by this, Governor-General Warren Hastings\npersecuted Hickey, and encouraged the publication of officially\nsanctioned newspapers that could counter the flow of information\nthat damaged the image of the colonial government. By the\nclose of the eighteenth century, a number of newspapers and\njournals appeared in print. There were Indians, too, who began\nto publish Indian newspapers. The first to appear was the weekly\nBengal Gazette, brought out by Gangadhar Bhattacharya, who\nwas close to Rammohun Roy.\nAs late as 1768, a William Bolts affixed a notice\non a public building in Calcutta:\n‘To the Public: Mr. Bolts takes this method of\ninforming the public that the want of a printing\npress in this city being of a great disadvantage in\nbusiness ... he is going to give the best\nencouragement to any ... persons who are\nversed in the business of printing.’\nBolts, however, left for England soon after and\nnothing came of the promise.\nSource\nSource C\nReprint 2025-26\n121\nPrint   Culture\n7  Religious Reform and Public Debates\nFrom the early nineteenth century, as you know, there were intense\ndebates around religious issues. Different groups confronted the\nchanges happening within colonial society in different ways, and\noffered a variety of new interpretations of the beliefs of different\nreligions. Some criticised existing practices and campaigned for\nreform, while others countered the arguments of reformers. These\ndebates were carried out in public and in print. Printed tracts and\nnewspapers not only spread the new ideas, but they shaped the\nnature of the debate. A wider public could now participate in these\npublic discussions and express their views. New ideas emerged\nthrough these clashes of opinions.\nThis was a time of intense controversies between social and religious\nreformers and the Hindu orthodoxy over matters like widow\nimmolation, monotheism, Brahmanical priesthood and idolatry. In\nBengal, as the debate developed, tracts and newspapers proliferated,\ncirculating a variety of arguments. To reach a wider audience, the\nideas were printed in the everyday, spoken language of ordinary\npeople. Rammohun Roy published the Sambad Kaumudi from 1821\nand the Hindu orthodoxy commissioned the Samachar Chandrika\nto oppose his opinions. From 1822, two Persian newspapers were\npublished, Jam-i-Jahan Nama and Shamsul Akhbar. In the same year,\na Gujarati newspaper, the Bombay Samachar, made its appearance.\nIn north India, the ulama were deeply anxious about the collapse\nof Muslim dynasties. They feared that colonial rulers would\nencourage conversion, change the Muslim personal laws. To counter\nthis, they used cheap lithographic presses, published Persian and\nUrdu translations of holy scriptures, and printed religious\nnewspapers and tracts. The Deoband Seminary, founded in 1867,\npublished thousands upon thousands of fatwas telling Muslim\nreaders how to conduct themselves in their everyday lives, and\nexplaining the meanings of Islamic doctrines. All through the\nnineteenth century, a number of Muslim sects and seminaries\nappeared, each with a different interpretation of faith, each keen\non enlarging its following and countering the influence of its\nopponents. Urdu print helped them conduct these battles in public.\nAmong Hindus, too, print encouraged the reading of religious texts,\nespecially in the vernacular languages. The first printed edition of\nNew words\nUlama – Legal scholars of Islam and the sharia\n( a body of Islamic law)\nFatwa – A legal pronouncement on Islamic\nlaw usually given by a mufti (legal scholar) to\nclarify issues on which the law is uncertain\nReprint 2025-26\nIndia and the Contemporary World\n122\nthe Ramcharitmanas of Tulsidas, a sixteenth-century text, came out\nfrom Calcutta in 1810. By the mid-nineteenth century, cheap\nlithographic editions flooded north Indian markets. From the 1880s,\nthe Naval Kishore Press at Lucknow and the Shri Venkateshwar\nPress in Bombay published numerous religious texts in vernaculars.\nIn their printed and portable form, these could be read easily by the\nfaithful at any place and time. They could also be read out to large\ngroups of illiterate men and women.\nReligious texts, therefore, reached a very wide circle of people,\nencouraging discussions, debates and controversies within and\namong different religions.       \nPrint did not only stimulate the publication of conflicting opinions\namongst communities, but it also connected communities and people\nin different parts of India. Newspapers conveyed news from one\nplace to another, creating pan-Indian identities.\nWhy Newspapers?\n‘Krishnaji Trimbuck Ranade inhabitant of Poona intends to publish a Newspaper in the Marathi Language with a view of\naffording useful information on every topic of local interest. It will be open for free discussion on subjects of general utility,\nscientific investigation and the speculations connected with the antiquities, statistics, curiosities, history and geography of\nthe country and of the Deccan especially… the patronage and support of all interested in the diffusion of knowledge and\nWelfare of the People is earnestly solicited.’\nBombay Telegraph and Courier, 6 January 1849\n‘The task of the native newspapers and political associations is identical to the role of the Opposition in the House of\nCommons in Parliament in England. That is of critically examining government policy to suggest improvements, by removing\nthose parts that will not be to the benefit of the people, and also by ensuring speedy implementation.\nThese associations ought to carefully study the particular issues, gather diverse relevant information on the nation as well\nas on what are the possible and desirable improvements, and this will surely earn it considerable influence.’\nNative Opinion, 3 April 1870.\nSource\nSource D\nReprint 2025-26\n123\nPrint   Culture\n8  New Forms of Publication\nPrinting created an appetite for new kinds of writing. As more and\nmore people could now read, they wanted to see their own lives,\nexperiences, emotions and relationships reflected in what they read.\nThe novel, a literary firm which had developed in Europe, ideally\ncatered to this need. It soon acquired distinctively Indian forms and\nstyles. For readers, it opened up new worlds of experience, and\ngave a vivid sense of the diversity of human lives.\nOther new literary forms also entered the world of reading –\nlyrics, short stories, essays about social and political matters. In\ndifferent ways, they reinforced the new emphasis on human lives\nand intimate feelings, about the political and social rules that shaped\nsuch things.\nBy the end of the nineteenth century, a new visual\nculture was taking shape. With the setting up of an\nincreasing number of printing presses, visual images\ncould be easily reproduced in multiple copies. Painters\nlike Raja Ravi Varma produced images for mass\ncirculation. Poor wood engravers who made\nwoodblocks set up shop near the letterpresses, and\nwere employed by print shops. Cheap prints and\ncalendars, easily available in the bazaar, could be\nbought even by the poor to decorate the walls of\ntheir homes or places of work. These prints began\nshaping popular ideas about modernity and tradition,\nreligion and politics, and society and culture.\nBy the 1870s, caricatures and cartoons were being\npublished in journals and newspapers, commenting\non social and political issues. Some caricatures\nridiculed the educated Indians’ fascination with\nWestern tastes and clothes, while others expressed\nthe fear of social change. There were imperial\ncaricatures lampooning nationalists, as well as\nnationalist cartoons criticising imperial rule.\nFig. 17 – Raja Ritudhwaj rescuing Princess Madalsa\nfrom the captivity of demons, print by Ravi Varma.\nRaja Ravi Varma produced innumerable mythological\npaintings that were printed at the Ravi Varma Press.\nReprint 2025-26\nIndia and the Contemporary World\n124\n8.1     Women and Print\nLives and feelings of women began to be written in particularly\nvivid and intense ways. Women’s reading, therefore, increased\nenormously in middle-class homes.  Liberal husbands and fathers\nbegan educating their womenfolk at home, and sent them to schools\nwhen women’s schools were set up in the cities and towns after the\nmid-nineteenth century. Many journals began carrying writings by\nwomen, and explained why women should be educated. They also\ncarried a syllabus and attached suitable reading matter which could\nbe used for home-based schooling.\nBut not all families were liberal. Conservative Hindus believed\nthat a literate girl would be widowed and Muslims feared that\neducated women would be corrupted by reading Urdu romances.\nSometimes, rebel women defied such prohibition. We know the\nstory of a girl in a conservative Muslim family of north India\nwho secretly learnt to read and write in Urdu. Her family wanted\nher to read only the Arabic Quran which she did not understand.\nSo she insisted on learning to read a language that was her own. In\nEast Bengal, in the early nineteenth century, Rashsundari Debi, a\nyoung married girl in a very orthodox household, learnt to read in\nthe secrecy of her kitchen. Later, she wrote her autobiography\nAmar Jiban which was published in 1876. It was the first full-length\nautobiography published in the Bengali language.\nSince social reforms and novels had already created a great interest\nin women’s lives and emotions, there was also an interest in what\nwomen would have to say about their own lives. From the 1860s,\na few Bengali women like Kailashbashini Debi wrote books\nhighlighting the experiences of women – about how women were\nimprisoned at home, kept in ignorance, forced to do hard domestic\nlabour and treated unjustly by the very people they served. In the\n1880s, in present-day Maharashtra, Tarabai Shinde and Pandita\nRamabai wrote with passionate anger about the miserable lives\nof upper-caste Hindu women, especially widows. A woman in a\nTamil novel expressed what reading meant to women who were\nso greatly confined by social regulations:  ‘For various reasons, my\nworld is small … More than half my life’s happiness has come\nfrom books …’\nWhile Urdu, Tamil, Bengali and Marathi print culture had developed\nearly, Hindi printing began seriously only from the 1870s. Soon, a\nlarge segment of it was devoted to the education of women.

They call\nthemselves Muslims and yet go against the basic\ntenet of Islam which gives Women an equal right\nto education. If men are not led astray once\neducated, why should women?’\nReprint 2025-26\n125\nPrint   Culture\nthe early twentieth century, journals, written for and sometimes\nedited by women, became extremely popular. They discussed\nissues like women’s education, widowhood, widow remarriage\nand the national movement. Some of them offered household\nand fashion lessons to women and brought entertainment through\nshort stories and serialised novels.\nIn Punjab, too, a similar folk literature was widely printed from\nthe early twentieth century. Ram Chaddha published the fast-selling\nIstri Dharm Vichar to teach women how to be obedient wives.\nThe Khalsa Tract Society published cheap booklets with a similar\nmessage. Many of these were in the form of dialogues about the\nqualities of a good woman.\nIn Bengal, an entire area in central Calcutta – the Battala – was\ndevoted to the printing of popular books. Here you could buy\ncheap editions of religious tracts and scriptures, as well as literature\nthat was considered obscene and scandalous. By the late nineteenth\ncentury, a lot of these books were being profusely illustrated with\nwoodcuts and coloured lithographs. Pedlars took the Battala\npublications to homes, enabling women to read them in their\nleisure time.\nFig. 20 – An Indian\ncouple, black and white\nwoodcut.\nThe image shows the\nartist’s fear that the\ncultural impact of the\nWest has turned the\nfamily upside down.\nNotice that the man is\nplaying the veena while\nthe woman is smoking a\nhookah.

Public libraries were set up from the early\ntwentieth century, expanding the access to books. These libraries were\nlocated mostly in cities and towns, and at times in prosperous villages.\nFor rich local patrons, setting up a library was a way of acquiring prestige.\nFrom the late nineteenth century, issues of caste discrimination began to\nbe written about in many printed tracts and essays. Jyotiba Phule, the\nMaratha pioneer of ‘low caste’ protest movements, wrote about the\ninjustices of the caste system in his Gulamgiri (1871). In the twentieth\ncentury, B.R. Ambedkar in Maharashtra and E.V. Ramaswamy Naicker\nin Madras, better known as Periyar, wrote powerfully on caste and\ntheir writings were read by people all over India. Local protest\nmovements and sects also created a lot of popular journals and tracts\ncriticising ancient scriptures and envisioning a new and just future.\nWorkers in factories were too overworked and lacked the education to\nwrite much about their experiences. But Kashibaba, a Kanpur\nmillworker, wrote and published Chhote Aur Bade Ka Sawal in 1938 to\nshow the links between caste and class exploitation.  The poems of\nanother Kanpur millworker, who wrote under the name of Sudarshan\nChakr between 1935 and 1955, were brought together and published\nin a collection called Sacchi Kavitayan. By the 1930s, Bangalore cotton\nmillworkers set up libraries to educate themselves, following the example\nof Bombay workers. These were sponsored by social reformers who\ntried to restrict excessive drinking among them, to bring literacy and,\nsometimes, to propagate the message of nationalism.\nLook at Figs. 19, 20 and 21 carefully.\nØ What comment are the artists making on the\nsocial changes taking place in society?\nØ What changes in society were taking place to\nprovoke this reaction?\nØ Do you agree with the artist’s view?\nActivity\nFig. 21 – A European couple sitting on chairs,\nnineteenth-century woodcut.\nThe picture suggests traditional family roles.

Strangely, its early measures to\ncontrol printed matter were directed against Englishmen in India\nwho were critical of Company misrule and hated the actions of\nparticular Company officers. The Company was worried that such\ncriticisms might be used by its critics in England to attack its trade\nmonopoly in India.\nBy the 1820s, the Calcutta Supreme Court passed certain regulations\nto control press freedom and the Company began encouraging\npublication of newspapers that would celebrate Britsh rule. In 1835,\nfaced with urgent petitions by editors of English and vernacular\nnewspapers, Governor-General Bentinck agreed to revise press laws.\nThomas Macaulay, a liberal colonial official, formulated new rules\nthat restored the earlier freedoms.\nAfter the revolt of 1857, the attitude to freedom of the press\nchanged. Enraged Englishmen demanded a clamp down on the\n‘native’ press. As vernacular newspapers became assertively\nnationalist, the colonial government began debating measures of\nstringent control.  In 1878, the Vernacular Press Act was passed,\nmodelled on the Irish Press Laws. It provided the government\nwith extensive rights to censor reports and editorials in the vernacular\npress. From now on the government kept regular track of the\nvernacular newspapers published in different provinces. When a\nreport was judged as seditious, the newspaper was warned, and if\nthe warning was ignored, the press was liable to be seized and the\nprinting machinery confiscated.\nDespite repressive measures, nationalist newspapers grew in numbers\nin all parts of India. They reported on colonial misrule and\nencouraged nationalist activities. Attempts to throttle nationalist\ncriticism provoked militant protest. This in turn led to a renewed\ncycle of persecution and protests. When Punjab revolutionaries were\ndeported in 1907, Balgangadhar Tilak wrote with great sympathy\nabout them in his Kesari. This led to his imprisonment in 1908,\nprovoking in turn widespread protests all over India.\nBox 4\nSometimes, the government found it hard to\nfind candidates for editorship of loyalist papers.\nWhen Sanders, editor of the Statesman that had\nbeen founded in 1877, was approached, he\nasked rudely how much he would be paid\nfor suffering the loss of freedom.

The colonial government kept\ncontinuous track of all books and newspapers\npublished in India and passed numerous laws to\ncontrol the press.\nDuring the First World War, under the Defence\nof India Rules, 22 newspapers had to furnish\nsecurities. Of these, 18 shut down rather than\ncomply with government orders. The Sedition\nCommittee Report under Rowlatt in 1919 further\nstrengthened controls that led to imposition of\npenalties on various newspapers. At the outbreak\nof the Second World War, the Defence of India\nAct was passed, allowing censoring of reports of\nwar-related topics. All reports about the Quit India\nmovement came under its purview.

Aladdin is shown as representing the\nEast and the past, the mechanic stands for the West and modernity.\nThese images offer us a triumphant account of the modern world.\nWithin this account the modern world is associated with rapid\ntechnological change and innovations, machines and factories, railways\nand steamships. The history of industrialisation thus becomes simply\na story of development, and the modern age appears as a wonderful\ntime of technological progress.\nThese images and associations have now become part of popular\nimagination. Do you not see rapid industrialisation as a time of\nprogress and modernity? Do you not think that the spread of railways\nand factories, and construction of high-rise buildings and bridges is\na sign of society’s development?\nHow have these images developed? And how do we relate to these\nideas? Is industrialisation always based on rapid technological\ndevelopment? Can we today continue to glorify continuous\nmechanisation of all work? What has industrialisation meant to\npeople’s lives? To answer such questions we need to turn to the\nhistory of industrialisation.\nIn this chapter we will look at this history by focusing first on Britain,\nthe first industrial nation, and then India, where the pattern of\nindustrial change was conditioned by colonial rule.\nFig. 2 – Two Magicians, published in Inland\nPrinters, 26 January 1901.\nReprint 2025-26\n81\nThe  Age  of  Industrialisation\nFig. 3 – Spinning in the eighteenth century.\nYou can see each member of the family involved in the\nproduction of yarn. Notice that one wheel is moving only one\nspindle.\n1  Before the Industrial Revolution\nAll too often we associate industrialisation with the growth of\nfactory industry. When we talk of industrial production we refer\nto factory production. When we talk of industrial workers we\nmean factory workers. Histories of industrialisation very often begin\nwith the setting up of the first factories.\nThere is a problem with such ideas. Even before factories began to\ndot the landscape in England and Europe, there was large-scale\nindustrial production for an international market. This was not based\non factories. Many historians now refer to this phase of\nindustrialisation as proto-industrialisation.\nIn the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, merchants from the towns\nin Europe began moving to the countryside, supplying money to\npeasants and artisans, persuading them to produce for an international\nmarket. With the expansion of world trade and the acquisition of\ncolonies in different parts of the world, the demand for goods\nbegan growing. But merchants could not expand production within\ntowns. This was because here urban crafts and trade guilds were\npowerful. These were associations of producers that trained\ncraftspeople, maintained control over production, regulated\ncompetition and prices, and restricted the entry of new people into\nthe trade. Rulers granted different guilds the monopoly\nright to produce and trade in specific products. It was\ntherefore difficult for new merchants to set up\nbusiness in towns. So they turned to the countryside.\nIn the countryside poor peasants and artisans began\nworking for merchants. As you have seen in the\ntextbook last year, this was a time when open fields\nwere disappearing and commons were being\nenclosed. Cottagers and poor peasants who had earlier\ndepended on common lands for their survival,\ngathering their firewood, berries, vegetables, hay and\nstraw, had to now look for alternative sources of\nincome. Many had tiny plots of land which could not\nprovide work for all members of the household. So\nwhen merchants came around and offered advances\nto produce goods for them, peasant households\neagerly agreed. By working for the merchants, they\nNew words\nProto – Indicating the first or early form\nof something\nReprint 2025-26\nIndia and the Contemporary World\n82\ncould remain in the countryside and continue to cultivate their small\nplots. Income from proto-industrial production supplemented their\nshrinking income from cultivation. It also allowed them a fuller use\nof their family labour resources.\nWithin this system a close relationship developed between the town\nand the countryside. Merchants were based in towns but the work\nwas done mostly in the countryside. A merchant clothier in England\npurchased wool from a wool stapler, and carried it to the spinners;\nthe yarn (thread) that was spun was taken in subsequent stages\nof production to weavers, fullers, and then to dyers. The finishing\nwas done in London before the export merchant sold the cloth in\nthe international market. London in fact came to be known as a\nfinishing centre.\nThis proto-industrial system was thus part of a network of\ncommercial exchanges. It was controlled by merchants and the goods\nwere produced by a vast number of producers working within\ntheir family farms, not in factories. At each stage of production 20\nto 25 workers were employed by each merchant. This meant that\neach clothier was controlling hundreds of workers.\n1.1 The Coming Up of the Factory\nThe earliest factories in England came up by the 1730s. But it\nwas only in the late eighteenth century that the number of\nfactories multiplied.\nThe first symbol of the new era was cotton. Its production boomed\nin the late nineteenth century. In 1760 Britain was importing 2.5\nmillion pounds of raw cotton to feed its cotton industry. By 1787\nthis import soared to 22 million pounds. This increase was linked to\na number of changes within the process of production. Let us look\nbriefly at some of these.\nA series of inventions in the eighteenth century increased the efficacy\nof each step of the production process (carding, twisting and\nspinning, and rolling). They enhanced the output per worker, enabling\neach worker to produce more, and they made possible the\nproduction of stronger threads and yarn. Then Richard Arkwright\ncreated the cotton mill. Till this time, as you have seen, cloth\nproduction was spread all over the countryside and carried out within\nvillage households. But now, the costly new machines could be\npurchased, set up and maintained in the mill. Within the mill all the\nNew words\nStapler – A person who ‘staples’ or sorts wool\naccording to its fibre\nFuller – A person who ‘fulls’ – that is, gathers\n– cloth by pleating\nCarding – The process in which fibres, such as\ncotton or wool, are prepared prior to spinning\nFig. 4 – A Lancashire cotton mill, painted by\nC.E. Turner, The Illustrated London News,\n1925.\nThe artist said: ‘Seen through the humid\natmosphere that makes Lancashire the best\ncotton-spinning locality in the world, a huge\ncotton-mill aglow with electricity in the\ntwilight, is a most impressive sight.’\nReprint 2025-26\n83\nThe  Age  of  Industrialisation\nprocesses were brought together under one roof and management.\nThis allowed a more careful supervision over the production process,\na watch over quality, and the regulation of labour, all of which had\nbeen difficult to do when production was in the countryside.\nIn the early nineteenth century, factories increasingly became an\nintimate part of the English landscape. So visible were the imposing\nnew mills, so magical seemed to be the power of new technology,\nthat contemporaries were dazzled. They concentrated their attention\non the mills, almost forgetting the bylanes and the workshops where\nproduction still continued.\nThe way in which historians focus on\nindustrialisation rather than on small\nworkshops is a good example of how what we\nbelieve today about the past is influenced by\nwhat historians choose to notice and what they\nignore. Note down one event or aspect of your\nown life which adults such as your parents or\nteachers may think is unimportant, but which\nyou believe to be important.\nActivity\n1.2 The Pace of Industrial Change\nHow rapid was the process of industrialisation? Does industrialisation\nmean only the growth of factory industries?\nFirst: The most dynamic industries in Britain were clearly cotton and\nmetals. Growing at a rapid pace, cotton was the leading sector in the\nfirst phase of industrialisation up to the 1840s. After that the iron\nand steel industry led the way. With the expansion of railways, in\nEngland from the 1840s and in the colonies from the 1860s, the\ndemand for iron and steel increased rapidly.

Jackson, The Illustrated London News, 1857.\nChimneys billowing smoke came to characterise the industrial landscape.\nReprint 2025-26\nIndia and the Contemporary World\n84\nSecond: the new industries could not easily displace traditional\nindustries. Even at the end of the nineteenth century, less than 20 per\ncent of the total workforce was employed in technologically\nadvanced industrial sectors. Textiles was a dynamic sector, but a\nlarge portion of the output was produced not within factories, but\noutside, within domestic units.\nThird: the pace of change in the ‘traditional’ industries was not set\nby steam-powered cotton or metal industries, but they did not remain\nentirely stagnant either. Seemingly ordinary and small innovations\nwere the basis of growth in many non-mechanised sectors such as\nfood processing, building, pottery, glass work, tanning, furniture\nmaking, and production of implements.\nFourth: technological changes occurred slowly. They did not spread\ndramatically across the industrial landscape. New technology was\nexpensive and merchants and industrialists were cautious about using\nit. The machines often broke down and repair was costly. They\nwere not as effective as their inventors and manufacturers claimed.\nConsider the case of the steam engine. James Watt improved the\nsteam engine produced by Newcomen and patented the new engine\nin 1781. His industrialist friend Mathew Boulton manufactured the\nnew model. But for years he could find no buyers. At the beginning\nof the nineteenth century, there were no more than 321 steam engines\nall over England. Of these, 80 were\nin cotton industries, nine in wool\nindustries, and the rest in mining,\ncanal works and iron works. Steam\nengines were not used in any of the\nother industries till much later in\nthe century. So even the most\npowerful new technology that\nenhanced the productivity of\nlabour manifold was slow to be\naccepted by industrialists.\nHistorians now have come to\nincreasingly recognise that the typical\nworker in the mid-nineteenth century\nwas not a machine operator but the\ntraditional craftsperson and labourer.\nFig. 6 – A fitting shop at a railway works in\nEngland, The Illustrated London News, 1849.\nIn the fitting shop new locomotive engines were\ncompleted and old ones repaired.\nFig. 7 – A spinning factory in 1830.\nYou can see how giant wheels moved by steam power could set in motion\nhundreds of spindles to manufacture thread.\nReprint 2025-26\n85\nThe  Age  of  Industrialisation\n2  Hand Labour and Steam Power\nIn Victorian Britain there was no shortage of human labour. Poor\npeasants and vagrants moved to the cities in large numbers in search\nof jobs, waiting for work. As you will know, when there is plenty of\nlabour, wages are low. So industrialists had no problem of labour\nshortage or high wage costs. They did not want to introduce machines\nthat got rid of human labour and required large capital investment.\nIn many industries the demand for labour was seasonal. Gas works\nand breweries were especially busy through the cold months. So\nthey needed more workers to meet their peak demand.  Book-\nbinders and printers, catering to Christmas demand, too needed\nextra hands before December. At the waterfront, winter was the\ntime that ships were repaired and spruced up. In all such industries\nwhere production fluctuated with the season, industrialists usually\npreferred hand labour, employing workers for the season.\nWill Thorne is one of those who went in search\nof seasonal work, loading bricks and doing odd\njobs. He describes how job-seekers walked to\nLondon in search of work:\n‘I had always wanted to go to London, and my\ndesire … was stimulated by letters from an old\nworkmate … who was now working at the Old\nKent Road Gas Works … I finally decided to go …\nin November, 1881. With two friends I started\nout to walk the journey, filled with the hope\nthat we would be able to obtain employment,\nwhen we get there, with the kind assistance of\nmy friend … we had little money when we\nstarted, not enough to pay for our food and\nlodgings each night until we arrived in London.\nSome days we walked as much as twenty miles,\nand other days less. Our money was gone at\nthe end of the third day … For two nights we\nslept out – once under a haystack, and once in\nan old farm shed … On arrival in London we tried\nto find … my friend … but … were unsuccessful.\nOur money was gone, so there was nothing for\nus to do but to walk around until late at night,\nand then try to find some place to sleep. We\nfound an old building and slept in it that night.\nThe next day, Sunday, late in the afternoon, we\ngot to the Old Kent Gas Works, and applied for\nwork. To my great surprise, the man we had\nbeen looking for was working at the time. He\nspoke to the foreman and I was given a job.’\nQuoted in Raphael Samuel, ‘Comers and Goers’,\nin H.J. Dyos and Michael Wolff, eds, The Victorian\nCity: Images and Realities, 1973.\nSource\nSource A\nA range of products could be produced only with hand\nlabour. Machines were oriented to producing uniforms,\nstandardised goods for a mass market. But the demand in the market\nwas often for goods with intricate designs and specific shapes.

These required\nhuman skill, not mechanical technology.\nIn Victorian Britain, the upper classes – the aristocrats and the\nbourgeoisie – preferred things produced by hand. Handmade\nproducts came to symbolise refinement and class. They were better\nfinished, individually produced, and carefully designed. Machine-\nmade goods were for export to the colonies.\nIn countries with labour shortage, industrialists were keen on using\nmechanical power so that the need for human labour can be\nminimised. This was the case in nineteenth-century America. Britain,\nhowever, had no problem hiring human hands.\n2.1 Life of the Workers\nThe abundance of labour in the market affected the lives of workers.\nAs news of possible jobs travelled to the countryside, hundreds\ntramped to the cities. The actual possibility of getting a job depended\non existing networks of friendship and kin relations. If you had\na relative or a friend in a factory, you were more likely to get a\njob quickly. But not everyone had social connections. Many job-\nseekers had to wait weeks, spending nights under bridges or in night\nFig. 9 – Workers in an iron works, north-east\nEngland, painting by William Bell Scott, 1861.\nMany artists from the late nineteenth century\nbegan idealising workers: they were shown\nsuffering hardship and pain for the cause of\nthe nation.\nFig. 10 – Houseless and Hungry, painting by Samuel Luke Fildes, 1874.\nThis painting shows the homeless in London applying for tickets to stay overnight in a workhouse. These shelters\nwere maintained under the supervision of the Poor Law Commissioners for the ‘destitute, wayfarers, wanderers and\nfoundling’. Staying in these workhouses was a humiliating experience: everyone was subjected to a medical\nexamination to see whether they were carrying disease, their bodies were cleansed, and their clothes purified. They\nhad to also do hard labour.\nReprint 2025-26\n87\nThe  Age  of  Industrialisation\nshelters. Some stayed in Night Refuges that were set up by private\nindividuals; others went to the Casual Wards maintained by the Poor\nLaw authorities.\nSeasonality of work in many industries meant prolonged periods\nwithout work. After the busy season was over, the poor were on\nthe streets again. Some returned to the countryside after the winter,\nwhen the demand for labour in the rural areas opened up in places.\nBut most looked for odd jobs, which till the mid-nineteenth century\nwere difficult to find.\nWages increased somewhat in the early nineteenth century. But they\ntell us little about the welfare of the workers. The average figures\nhide the variations between trades and the fluctuations from year to\nyear. For instance, when prices rose sharply during the prolonged\nNapoleonic War, the real value of what the workers earned fell\nsignificantly, since the same wages could now buy fewer things.\nMoreover, the income of workers depended not on the wage rate\nalone. What was also critical was the period of employment: the\nnumber of days of work determined the average daily income of\nthe workers. At the best of times till the mid-nineteenth century,\nabout 10 per cent of the urban population were extremely poor. In\nperiods of economic slump, like the 1830s, the proportion of\nunemployed went up to anything between 35 and 75 per cent in\ndifferent regions.\nThe fear of unemployment made workers hostile to the introduction\nof new technology. When the Spinning Jenny was introduced in\nA magistrate reported in 1790 about an incident when he was\ncalled in to protect a manufacturer’s property from being attacked\nby workers:\n‘From the depredations of a lawless Banditti of colliers and their\nwives, for the wives had lost their work to spinning engines … they\nadvanced at first with much insolence, avowing their intention of\ncutting to pieces the machine lately introduced in the woollen\nmanufacture; which they suppose, if generally adopted, will lessen\nthe demand for manual labour. The women became clamorous.\nThe men were more open to conviction and after some\nexpostulation were induced to desist from their purpose and return\npeaceably home.’\nJ.L. Hammond and B.

Once\nagain we will look not only at factory industries but also at the\nnon-mechanised sector. We will limit our discussion primarily to\ntextile industries.\n3.1 The Age of Indian Textiles\nBefore the age of machine industries, silk and cotton goods from\nIndia dominated the international market in textiles. Coarser cottons\nwere produced in many countries, but the finer varieties often came\nfrom India. Armenian and Persian merchants took the goods from\nPunjab to Afghanistan, eastern Persia and Central Asia.  Bales of fine\ntextiles were carried on camel back via the north-west frontier, through\nmountain passes and across deserts. A vibrant sea trade operated\nthrough the main pre-colonial ports. Surat on the Gujarat coast\nconnected India to the Gulf and Red Sea Ports; Masulipatam on\nthe Coromandel coast  and Hoogly in Bengal had trade links with\nSoutheast Asian ports.\nA variety of Indian merchants and bankers were involved in this\nnetwork of export trade – financing production, carrying goods\nand supplying exporters. Supply merchants linked the port towns to\nthe inland regions. They gave advances to weavers, procured the\nwoven cloth from weaving villages, and carried the supply to the\nports. At the port, the big shippers and export merchants had brokers\nwho negotiated the price and bought goods from the supply\nmerchants operating inland.\nBy the 1750s this network, controlled by Indian merchants, was\nbreaking down.\nThe European companies gradually gained power – first securing a\nvariety of concessions from local courts, then the monopoly rights\nto trade. This resulted in a decline of the old ports of Surat and\nHoogly through which local merchants had operated. Exports from\nthese ports fell dramatically, the credit that had financed the earlier\ntrade began drying up, and the local bankers slowly went bankrupt.\nIn the last years of the seventeenth century, the gross value of trade\nthat passed through Surat had been Rs 16 million. By the 1740s it\nhad slumped to Rs 3 million.\nOn a map of Asia, find and draw the sea and\nland links of the textile trade from India to\nCentral Asia, West Asia and Southeast Asia.\nActivity\nReprint 2025-26\nIndia and the Contemporary World\n90\nWhile Surat and Hoogly decayed, Bombay and Calcutta grew. This\nshift from the old ports to the new ones was an indicator of the\ngrowth of colonial power. Trade through the new ports came to\nbe controlled by European companies, and was carried in European\nships. While many of the old trading houses collapsed, those that\nwanted to survive had to now operate within a network shaped by\nEuropean trading companies.\nHow did these changes affect the life of weavers and other artisans?\n3.2 What Happened to Weavers?\nThe consolidation of East India Company power after the 1760s\ndid not initially lead to a decline in textile exports from India. British\ncotton industries had not yet expanded and Indian fine textiles were\nin great demand in Europe. So the company was keen on expanding\ntextile exports from India.\nBefore establishing political power in Bengal and Carnatic in the\n1760s and 1770s, the East India Company had found it difficult to\nensure a regular supply of goods for export. The French, Dutch,\nFig. 13 – The English factory at Surat, a seventeenth-century drawing.\nFig. 14 – A weaver at work, Gujarat.\nReprint 2025-26\n91\nThe  Age  of  Industrialisation\nPortuguese as well as the local traders competed in the market\nto secure woven cloth. So the weaver and supply merchants\ncould bargain and try selling the produce to the best buyer. In\ntheir letters back to London, Company officials continuously\ncomplained of difficulties of supply and the high prices.\nHowever, once the East India Company established political\npower, it could assert a monopoly right to trade. It proceeded\nto develop a system of management and control that would\neliminate competition, control costs, and ensure regular supplies\nof cotton and silk goods. This it did through a series of steps.\nFirst: the Company tried to eliminate the existing traders and\nbrokers connected with the cloth trade, and establish a more\ndirect control over the weaver. It appointed a paid servant called\nthe gomastha to supervise weavers, collect supplies, and examine\nthe quality of cloth.\nSecond: it prevented Company weavers from dealing with other\nbuyers. One way of doing this was through the system of advances.\nOnce an order was placed, the weavers were given loans to purchase\nthe raw material for their production. Those who took loans had to\nhand over the cloth they produced to the gomastha. They could not\ntake it to any other trader.\nAs loans flowed in and the demand for fine textiles expanded,\nweavers eagerly took the advances, hoping to earn more. Many\nweavers had small plots of land which they had earlier cultivated\nalong with weaving, and the produce from this took care of their\nfamily needs. Now they had to lease out the land and devote all their\ntime to weaving. Weaving, in fact, required the labour of the entire\nfamily, with children and women all engaged in different stages of\nthe process.\nSoon, however, in many weaving villages there were reports of\nclashes between weavers and gomasthas. Earlier supply merchants had\nvery often lived within the weaving  villages, and had a close\nrelationship with the weavers, looking after their needs and helping\nthem in times of crisis. The new gomasthas were outsiders, with no\nlong-term social link with the village. They acted arrogantly, marched\ninto villages with sepoys and peons, and punished weavers for delays\nin supply – often beating and flogging them. The weavers lost the\nspace to bargain for prices and sell to different buyers: the price they\nreceived from the Company was miserably low and the loans they\nhad accepted tied them to the Company.\nNew words\nSepoy – This is how the British pronounced\nthe word sipahi, meaning an Indian soldier in\nthe service of the British\nReprint 2025-26\nIndia and the Contemporary World\n92\nIn many places in Carnatic and Bengal, weavers deserted villages\nand migrated, setting up looms in other villages where they had\nsome family relation. Elsewhere, weavers along with the village\ntraders revolted, opposing the Company and its officials. Over time\nmany weavers began refusing loans, closing down their workshops\nand taking to agricultural labour.\nBy the turn of the nineteenth century, cotton weavers faced a\nnew set of problems.\n3.3 Manchester Comes to India\nIn 1772, Henry Patullo, a Company official, had ventured to\nsay that the demand for Indian textiles could never reduce, since\nno other nation produced goods of the same quality. Yet by\nthe beginning of the nineteenth century we see the beginning of\na long decline of textile exports from India. In 1811-12\npiece-goods accounted for 33 per cent of India’s exports; by\n1850-51 it was no more than 3 per cent.\nWhy did this happen? What were its implications?\nAs cotton industries developed in England, industrial groups began\nworrying about imports from other countries. They pressurised\nthe government to impose import duties on cotton textiles so that\nManchester goods could sell in Britain without facing any\ncompetition from outside. At the same time industrialists persuaded\nthe East India Company  to sell British manufactures in Indian\nmarkets as well. Exports of British cotton goods increased\ndramatically in the early nineteenth century.  At the end of the\neighteenth century there had been virtually no import of cotton\npiece-goods into India.  But by 1850 cotton piece-goods constituted\nover 31 per cent of the value of Indian imports; and by the 1870s\nthis figure  was over 50 per cent.\nCotton weavers in India thus faced two problems at the same time:\ntheir export market collapsed, and the local market shrank, being\nglutted with Manchester imports. Produced by machines at lower\ncosts, the imported cotton goods were so cheap that weavers could\nnot easily compete with them. By the 1850s, reports from most\nweaving regions of India narrated stories of decline and desolation.\nBy the 1860s, weavers faced a new problem. They could not get\nsufficient supply of raw cotton of good quality. When the American\nThe Commissioner of Patna wrote:\n‘It appears that twenty yeas ago, a brisk trade\nwas carried on in the manufacture of cloth at\nJahanabad, and Behar, which has in the former\nplace entirely ceased, while in the latter the\namount of manufacture is very limited, in\nconsequence of the cheap and durable goods\nfrom Manchester with which the Native\nmanufactures are unable to compete.’\nQuoted in J.

As raw cotton exports from India\nincreased, the price of raw cotton shot up. Weavers in India\nwere starved of supplies and forced to buy raw cotton at\nexorbitant prices. In this, situation weaving could not pay.\nThen, by the end of the nineteenth century, weavers and other\ncraftspeople faced yet another problem. Factories in India began\nproduction, flooding the market with machine-goods. How could\nweaving industries possibly survive?\nFig. 15 –  Bombay harbour, a late-eighteenth-century drawing.\nBombay and Calcutta grew as trading ports from the 1780s. This marked the decline of the old trading order\nand the growth of the colonial economy.\nReprint 2025-26\nIndia and the Contemporary World\n94\n4  Factories Come Up\nThe first cotton mill in Bombay came up in 1854 and it went into\nproduction two years later. By 1862 four mills were at work with\n94,000 spindles and 2,150 looms. Around the same time jute mills\ncame up in Bengal, the first being set up in 1855 and another one\nseven years later, in 1862. In north India, the Elgin Mill was started\nin Kanpur in the 1860s, and a year later the first cotton mill of\nAhmedabad was set up. By 1874, the first spinning and weaving\nmill of Madras began production.\nWho set up the industries? Where did the capital come from? Who\ncame to work in the mills?\n4.1 The Early Entrepreneurs\nIndustries were set up in different regions by varying sorts of people.\nLet us see who they were.\nThe history of many business groups goes back to trade with China.\nFrom the late eighteenth century, as you have read in your book last\nyear, the British in India began exporting opium to China and took\ntea from China to England. Many Indians became junior players in\nthis trade, providing finance, procuring supplies, and shipping\nconsignments. Having earned through trade, some of these\nbusinessmen had visions of developing industrial enterprises in India.\nIn Bengal, Dwarkanath Tagore made his fortune in the China trade\nbefore he turned to industrial investment, setting up six joint-stock\ncompanies in the 1830s and 1840s.  Tagore’s enterprises sank along\nwith those of others in the wider business crises of the 1840s, but\nlater in the nineteenth century many of the China traders became\nsuccessful industrialists. In Bombay, Parsis like Dinshaw Petit and\nJamsetjee Nusserwanjee Tata who built huge industrial empires in\nIndia, accumulated their initial wealth partly from exports to China,\nand partly from raw cotton shipments to England. Seth Hukumchand,\na Marwari businessman who set up the first Indian jute mill in\nCalcutta in 1917, also traded with China. So did the father as well as\ngrandfather of the famous industrialist G.D. Birla.\nCapital was accumulated through other trade networks. Some\nmerchants from Madras traded with Burma while others had links\nwith the Middle East and East Africa. There were yet other\nFig. 17 – Dwarkanath Tagore.\nDwarkanath Tagore believed that India would\ndevelop through westernisation and\nindustrialisation. He invested in shipping,\nshipbuilding, mining, banking, plantations\nand insurance.\nFig. 16 – Jamsetjee Jeejeebhoy.\nJeejeebhoy was the son of a Parsi weaver. Like\nmany others of his time, he was involved in\nthe China trade and shipping. He owned a\nlarge fleet of ships, but competition from\nEnglish and American shippers forced him to\nsell his ships by the 1850s.\nReprint 2025-26\n95\nThe  Age  of  Industrialisation\ncommercial groups, but they were not directly involved in external\ntrade. They operated within India, carrying goods from one place\nto another, banking money, transferring funds between cities, and\nfinancing traders. When opportunities of investment in industries\nopened up, many of them set up factories.\nAs colonial control over Indian trade tightened,  the space within\nwhich Indian merchants could function became increasingly limited.\nThey were barred from trading with Europe in manufactured goods,\nand had to export mostly raw materials and food grains – raw\ncotton, opium, wheat and indigo – required by the British. They\nwere also gradually edged out of the shipping business.\nTill the First World War, European Managing Agencies in fact\ncontrolled a large sector of Indian industries. Three of the biggest\nones were Bird Heiglers & Co., Andrew Yule, and Jardine Skinner\n& Co. These Agencies mobilised capital, set up joint-stock companies\nand managed them. In most instances Indian financiers provided\nthe capital while the European Agencies made all investment and\nbusiness decisions. The European merchant-industrialists had their\nown chambers of commerce which Indian businessmen were not\nallowed to join.\n4.2 Where Did the Workers Come From?\nFactories needed workers. With the expansion of factories, this\ndemand increased. In 1901, there were 584,000 workers in Indian\nfactories. By 1946 the number was over 2,436, 000. Where did the\nworkers come from?\n In most industrial regions workers came from the districts around.\nPeasants and artisans who found no work in the village went to the\nindustrial centres in search of work. Over 50 per cent workers in the\nBombay cotton industries in 1911 came from the neighbouring\ndistrict of Ratnagiri, while the mills of Kanpur got most of their\ntextile hands from the villages within the district of Kanpur. Most\noften millworkers moved between the village and the city, returning\nto their village homes during harvests and festivals.\nOver time, as news of employment spread, workers travelled great\ndistances in the hope of work in the mills. From the United Provinces,\nfor instance, they went to work in the textile mills of Bombay and in\nthe jute mills of Calcutta.\nFig. 18 –  Partners in enterprise – J.N. Tata,\nR.D. Tata, Sir R.J. Tata, and Sir D.J. Tata.\nIn 1912, J.N. Tata set up the first iron and steel\nworks in India at Jamshedpur. Iron and steel\nindustries in India started much later than\ntextiles. In colonial India industrial machinery,\nrailways and locomotives were mostly imported.\nSo capital goods industries could not really\ndevelop in any significant way till Independence.\nFig. 19 – Young workers of a Bombay\nmill, early twentieth century.\nWhen workers went back to their village\nhomes, they liked dressing up.\nReprint 2025-26\nIndia and the Contemporary World\n96\nGetting jobs was always difficult, even when mills multiplied and\nthe demand for workers increased. The numbers seeking work were\nalways more than the jobs available.  Entry into the mills was also\nrestricted. Industrialists usually employed a jobber to get new recruits.\nVery often the jobber was an old and trusted worker. He got people\nfrom his village, ensured them jobs, helped them settle in the city\nand provided them money in times of crisis. The jobber therefore\nbecame a person with some authority and power. He began\ndemanding money and gifts for his favour and controlling the lives\nof workers.\nThe number of factory workers increased over time. However,\nas you will see, they were a small proportion of the total\nindustrial workforce.\nVasant Parkar, who was once a millworker in Bombay, said:\n‘The workers would pay the jobbers money to get their sons work\nin the mill … The mill worker was closely associated with his village,\nphysically and emotionally. He would go home to cut the harvest\nand for sowing. The Konkani would go home to cut the paddy\nand the Ghati, the sugarcane. It was an accepted practice for\nwhich the mills granted leave.’\nMeena Menon and Neera Adarkar, One Hundred Years: One Hundred\nVoices, 2004.\nSource\nSource E\nBhai Bhosle, a trade unionist of Bombay,\nrecollected his childhood in the 1930s and 1940s:\n‘In those days, the shift was 10 hours – from\n5 pm to 3 am – terrible working hours. My father\nworked for 35 years; he got the asthma like\ndisease and could not work any more…Then my\nfather went back to village.’\nMeena Menon and Neera Adarkar, One Hundred\nYears: One Hundred Voices.\nSource\nSource F\nFig. 20 – A head jobber.\nNotice how the posture and clothes\nemphasise the jobber’s position of\nauthority.\nFig. 21 – Spinners at work in an Ahmedabad mill.\nWomen worked mostly in the spinning departments.\nReprint 2025-26\n97\nThe  Age  of  Industrialisation\nFig. 22 – The first office of the Madras Chamber of Commerce.\nBy the late nineteenth century merchants in different regions began\nmeeting and forming Chambers of Commerce to regulate business and\ndecide on issues of collective concern.\n5  The Peculiarities of Industrial Growth\nEuropean Managing Agencies, which dominated industrial\nproduction in India, were interested in certain kinds of products.\nThey established tea and coffee plantations, acquiring land at cheap\nrates from the colonial government; and they invested in mining,\nindigo and jute. Most of these were products required primarily for\nexport trade and not for sale in India.\nWhen Indian businessmen began setting up industries in the late\nnineteenth century, they avoided competing with Manchester goods\nin the Indian market. Since yarn was not an important part of British\nimports into India, the early cotton mills in India produced coarse\ncotton yarn (thread) rather than fabric. When yarn was imported it\nwas only of the superior variety. The yarn produced in Indian spinning\nmills was used by handloom weavers in India or exported to China.\nBy the first decade of the twentieth century a series of changes\naffected the pattern of industrialisation. As the swadeshi movement\ngathered momentum, nationalists mobilised people to boycott foreign\ncloth. Industrial groups organised themselves to protect their collective\ninterests, pressurising the government to increase tariff protection\nand grant other concessions. From 1906, moreover, the export of\nIndian yarn to China declined since produce from Chinese and\nJapanese mills flooded the Chinese market.\nSo industrialists in India began shifting from\nyarn to cloth production.  Cotton piece-\ngoods production in India doubled between\n1900 and 1912.\nYet, till the First World War, industrial growth\nwas slow. The war created a dramatically\nnew situation. With British mills busy with\nwar production to meet the needs of the\narmy, Manchester imports into India\ndeclined. Suddenly, Indian mills had a vast\nhome market to supply. As the war\nprolonged, Indian factories were called\nupon to supply war needs: jute bags, cloth\nfor army uniforms, tents and leather boots,\nhorse and mule saddles and a host of other\nitems. New factories were set up and old\nReprint 2025-26\nIndia and the Contemporary World\n98\nones ran multiple shifts. Many new workers were employed and\neveryone was made to work longer hours. Over the war years\nindustrial production boomed.\nAfter the war, Manchester could never recapture its old position in\nthe Indian market. Unable to modernise and compete with the  US,\nGermany and Japan, the economy of Britain crumbled after the\nwar. Cotton production collapsed and exports of cotton cloth from\nBritain fell dramatically. Within the colonies, local industrialists\ngradually consolidated their position, substituting foreign\nmanufactures and capturing the home market.\n5.1 Small-scale Industries Predominate\nWhile factory industries grew steadily after the war, large industries\nformed only a small segment of the economy.  Most of them –\nabout 67 per cent in 1911 – were located in Bengal and Bombay.\nOver the rest of the country, small-scale production continued to\npredominate. Only a small proportion of the total industrial labour\nforce worked in registered factories: 5 per cent in 1911 and 10 per\ncent in 1931. The rest worked in small workshops and household\nunits, often located in alleys and bylanes, invisible to the passer-by.\nIn fact, in some instances, handicrafts production actually expanded\nin the twentieth century. This is true even in the case of the handloom\nsector that we have discussed. While cheap machine-made thread\nwiped out the spinning industry in the nineteenth century, the weavers\nsurvived, despite problems. In the twentieth century, handloom\ncloth production expanded steadily: almost trebling between 1900\nand 1940.\nHow did this happen?\nThis was partly because of technological changes. Handicrafts people\nadopt new technology if that helps them improve production\nwithout excessively pushing up costs. So, by the second decade of\nthe twentieth century we find weavers using looms with a fly shuttle.\nThis increased productivity per worker, speeded up production and\nreduced labour demand. By 1941, over 35 per cent of handlooms\nin India were fitted with fly shuttles: in regions like Travancore,\nMadras, Mysore, Cochin, Bengal the proportion was 70 to 80 per\ncent. There were several other small innovations that helped weavers\nimprove their productivity and compete with the mill sector.\nFig. 23 – A Hand-woven\nCloth.\nThe intricate designs of\nhand-woven cloth could\nnot be easily copied by the\nmills.\nNew words\nFly shuttle – It is a mechanical device used for\nweaving, moved by means of ropes and pullies.\nIt places the horizontal threads ( called the weft)\ninto the verticle threads (called the warp). The\ninvention of the fly shuttle made it possible\nfor weavers to operate large looms and weave\nwide pieces of cloth.\nReprint 2025-26\n99\nThe  Age  of  Industrialisation\nCertain groups of weavers were in a better position than others to\nsurvive the competition with mill industries. Amongst weavers some\nproduced coarse cloth while others wove finer varieties. The coarser\ncloth was bought by the poor and its demand fluctuated violently.\nIn times of bad harvests and famines, when the rural poor had little\nto eat, and their cash income disappeared, they could not possibly\nbuy cloth. The demand for the finer varieties bought by the\nwell-to-do was more stable. The rich could buy these even when the\npoor starved. Famines did not affect the sale of Banarasi or\nBaluchari saris. Moreover, as you have seen, mills could not imitate\nspecialised weaves. Saris with woven borders, or the famous lungis\nand handkerchiefs of Madras, could not be easily displaced by\nmill production.\nWeavers and other craftspeople who continued to expand\nproduction through the twentieth century, did not necessarily prosper.\nThey lived hard lives and worked long hours. Very often the entire\nhousehold – including all the women and children – had to work at\nvarious stages of the production process. But they were not simply\nremnants of past times in the age of factories. Their life and labour\nwas integral to the process of industrialisation.\nFig. 24 – Location of large-scale industries in India, 1931.\nThe circles indicate the size of industries in the different\nregions.\nMadras\nBombay\nBengal\nBihar\nUnited Provinces\nPunjab\nCentral Provinces\nReprint 2025-26\nIndia and the Contemporary World\n100\n6  Market for Goods\nWe have seen how British manufacturers attempted to take over\nthe Indian market, and how Indian weavers and craftsmen, traders\nand industrialists resisted colonial controls, demanded tariff\nprotection, created their own spaces, and tried to extend the market\nfor their produce.\nBut when new products are produced people have to be\npersuaded to buy them. They have to feel like using the product.\nHow was this done?\nOne way in which new consumers are created is through\nadvertisements. As you know, advertisements make products appear\ndesirable and necessary. They try to shape the minds of people and\ncreate new needs. Today we live in a world where advertisements\nsurround us. They appear in newspapers, magazines, hoardings, street\nwalls, television screens. But if we look back into history we find\nthat from the very beginning of the industrial age, advertisements\nhave played a part in expanding the markets for products, and in\nshaping a new consumer culture.\nWhen Manchester industrialists began selling cloth in India, they put\nlabels on the cloth bundles. The label was needed to make the place\nof manufacture and the name of the company familiar to the buyer.\nThe label was also to be a mark of quality. When buyers saw ‘MADE\nIN MANCHESTER’ written in bold on the label, they were\nexpected to feel confident about buying the cloth.\nFig. 26(a) – Manchester labels, early\ntwentieth century.\nImages of numerous Indian gods and\ngoddesses – Kartika, Lakshmi,\nSaraswati – are shown in imported\ncloth labels approving the quality of\nthe product being marketed.\nFig. 26(b) – Maharaja Ranjit Singh on\na Manchester label.\nHistoric figures are used to create\nrespect for the product.\nFig. 25 – Gripe Water calendar of 1928 by\nM.V. Dhurandhar.\nThe image of baby Krishna was most\ncommonly used to popularise baby products.\nFig. 26(a)                                          Fig. 26(b)\nReprint 2025-26\n101\nThe  Age  of  Industrialisation\nBut labels did not only carry words and texts. They also carried\nimages and were very often beautifully illustrated. If we look\nat these old labels, we can have some idea of the mind of the\nmanufacturers, their calculations, and the way they appealed to\nthe people.\nImages of Indian gods and goddesses regularly appeared on these\nlabels. It was as if the association with gods gave divine approval to\nthe goods being sold. The imprinted image of Krishna or Saraswati\nwas also intended to make the manufacture from a foreign land\nappear somewhat familiar to Indian people.\nBy the late nineteenth century, manufacturers were printing calendars\nto popularise their products. Unlike newspapers and magazines,\ncalendars were used even by people who could not read. They were\nhung in tea shops and in poor people’s homes just as much as in\noffices and middle-class apartments. And those who hung the\ncalendars had to see the advertisements, day after day, through the\nyear. In these calendars, once again, we see the figures of gods being\nused to sell new products.\nLike the images of gods, figures of important personages, of\nemperors and nawabs, adorned advertisement and calendars. The\nmessage very often seemed to say: if you respect the royal figure,\nthen respect this product; when the product was being used by\nkings, or produced under royal command, its quality could not\nbe questioned.\nWhen Indian manufacturers advertised the nationalist message was\nclear and loud. If you care for the nation then buy products that\nIndians produce. Advertisements became a vehicle of the nationalist\nmessage of swadeshi.\nConclusion\nClearly, the age of industries has meant major technological changes,\ngrowth of factories, and the making of a new industrial labour\nforce. However, as you have seen, hand technology and small-scale\nproduction remained an important part of the industrial landscape.\nLook again at Figs. 1 and 2.

That was because Delhi became an \nimportant city only in the twelfth century.  \nof a kingdom under the Tomara Rajputs, who were \ndefeated in the middle of the twelfth century by the \nChauhans (also referred to as Chahamanas) of Ajmer. \nIt was under the Tomaras and Chauhans that Delhi \nbecame an important commercial centre.

And soldiers cannot \nlive without salaries. Salaries come from the revenue collected \nfrom peasants. But peasants can pay revenue only when \nthey are prosperous and happy. This happens when the king \npromotes justice and honest governance.\nDo you think the \ncircle of justice \nis an appropriate \nterm to describe \nthe relationship \nbetween the king \nand his subjects? \nBirthright\nPrivileges claimed \non account of \nbirth. For example, \npeople believed \nthat nobles \ninherited their \nrights to govern, \nbecause they were \nborn in certain \nfamilies.\nGender \ndistinctions\nSocial and \nbiological \ndifferences \nbetween women \nand men. Usually, \nthese differences \nare used to argue \nthat men are \nsuperior to women. \nKeep the following additional details in mind:  \n(1) the authors of \n lived in cities (mainly \nDelhi) and hardly ever in villages. (2) They often wrote \ntheir histories for Sultans in the hope of rich rewards.  \n(3) These authors advised rulers on the need to \npreserve an “ideal” social order based on birthright \nand gender distinctions. Their ideas were not shared \nby everybody.\n In 1236 Sultan Iltutmish’s daughter, Raziyya, \nbecame Sultan. The chronicler of the age, \nMinhaj-us-Siraj, recognised that she was more able \ncomfortable at having a queen as ruler. Nor were the \nnobles happy at her attempts to rule independently. \nShe was removed from the throne in 1240.\n33\nDELHI: 12TH TO 15TH... \nWhat Minhaj-us-Siraj thought about  \nRaziyya: What other important  \nfemale rulers of India did?\nMinhaj-us-Siraj thought that the queen’s rule went \nagainst the ideal social order created by God, in which \nwomen were supposed to be subordinate to men. He \ntherefore asked: “In the register of God’s creation, since \nher account did not fall under the column of men, how \ndid she gain from all of her excellent qualities?” \nOn her inscriptions and coins Raziyya mentioned \nthat she was the daughter of Sultan Iltutmish. \nThis was in contrast to the queen Rudramadevi  \n(1262–1289), of the Kakatiya dynasty of Warangal, \npart of modern Andhra Pradesh. Rudramadevi \nchanged her name on her inscriptions and pretended \nshe was a man. Another queen, Didda, ruled in \nKashmir (980–1003). Her title is interesting: it comes \nfrom “didi” or “elder sister”, an obviously affectionate \nterm given to a loved ruler by her subjects. \nExpress Minhaj’s ideas in your own words. Do you \nthink Raziyya shared these ideas? Why do you \nthink it was so difficult for a woman to be a ruler? \n?\nA Closer Look: Administration under \nthe Khaljis and Tughluqs\nThe consolidation of a kingdom as vast as the    \nDelhi Sultanate needed reliable governors and \nadministrators. Rather than appointing aristocrats \nand landed chieftains as governors, the early Delhi \nSultans, especially Iltutmish, favoured their special \nslaves purchased for military service, called \n \nin Persian. They were carefully trained to man some \nSince they were totally dependent upon their master, \nthe Sultan could trust and rely upon them. \n34\nOUR PASTS – II\n?\n?\nClient \nSomeone who \nis under the \nprotection of \nanother; a \ndependent or \nhanger-on. \nSlaves rather than sons\nThe Sultans were advised:\n A slave, whom one has brought up and promoted, must be \nlooked after for it needs a whole lifetime and good luck to \nCan you think of any reason why a slave would \nbe better than a son?\nThe Khaljis and Tughluqs continued to use \n \nand also raised people of humble birth, who were often \ntheir clients, to high political positions. They were \nappointed as generals and governors. However, this \nalso introduced an element of political instability. \nSlaves and clients were loyal to their masters and \npatrons, but not to their heirs. Sultans had their own \nservants. As a result the accession of a new monarch \nThe patronage of these humble people by the Delhi \nSultans also shocked many elites and the authors \nof Persian \n criticised the Delhi Sultans for \nOfficials of Sultan Muhammad Tughluq \nSultan Muhammad Tughluq appointed Aziz Khummar, \na wine distiller, Firuz Hajjam, a barber, Manka \nTabbakh, a cook, and two gardeners, Ladha and \nPira, to high administrative posts. Ziyauddin Barani, \na mid-fourteenth-century chronicler, reported their \nappointments as a sign of the Sultan’s loss of political \njudgement and his incapacity to rule. \nWhy do you think Barani criticised the Sultan?\n35\nDELHI: 12TH TO 15TH... \nLike the earlier Sultans, the Khalji and Tughluq \nmonarchs appointed military commanders as \ngovernors of territories of varying sizes. These lands \nwere called \nand their holder was called \n \nor \n. The duty of the \n was to lead military \ncampaigns and maintain law and order in their \n. \nIn exchange for their military services, the \n \ncollected the revenues of their assignments as salary. \nThey also paid their soldiers from these revenues. \nControl over \nwas not inheritable and if they were assigned \n \nfor a short period of time before being shifted. These \nharsh conditions of service were rigorously imposed \nduring the reigns of Alauddin Khalji and Muhammad \nTughluq. Accountants were appointed by the state to \ncheck the amount of revenue collected by the \n. \nCare was taken that the \n collected only the taxes \nprescribed by the state and that he kept the required \nnumber of soldiers. \nAs the Delhi Sultans brought the hinterland of \nthe cities under their control, they forced the landed \nchieftains – the \naristocrats – and rich landlords \nto accept their authority. Under Alauddin Khalji the \nstate brought the assessment and collection of land \nrevenue under its own control. The rights of the local \nchieftains to levy taxes were cancelled and they were \nalso forced to pay taxes. The Sultan’s administrators \nmeasured the land and kept careful accounts. Some of \nthe old chieftains and landlords served the Sultanate \nas revenue collectors and assessors. There were \nthree types of taxes: (1) on cultivation called \n \nand amounting to about 50 per cent of the peasant’s \nproduce, (2) on cattle and (3) on houses.\nIt is important to remember that large parts of \nthe subcontinent remained outside the control of \nprovinces like Bengal from Delhi and soon after \nannexing southern India, the entire region became \nindependent.

As \n gained \npower and wealth, they declared \nthemselves to be \n, \n (the great \nlord of a “circle” or region) and so \nindependence from their overlords. \nOne such instance was that of \nthe Rashtrakutas in the Deccan. \nInitially they were subordinate to \nthe Chalukyas of Karnataka. In the \nmid-eighth century, Dantidurga, a \nRashtrakuta chief, overthrew his Chalukya overlord and \nperformed a ritual called \n (literally, the \ngolden womb). When this ritual was performed with \nthe help of Brahmanas, it was thought to lead to the \nnot one by birth.   \nIn other cases, men from enterprising families \nused their military skills to carve out kingdoms. For \ninstance, the Kadamba Mayurasharman and the \nGurjara-Pratihara Harichandra were Brahmanas who \ngave up their traditional professions and took to arms, \nsuccessfully establishing kingdoms in Karnataka and \nRajasthan respectively.  \nAdministration in the Kingdoms\nMany of these new kings adopted high-sounding \ntitles such as \n (great king, overlord \nof kings), \n (lord of the three \nworlds) and so on. However, in spite of such claims, \nDo you think \nbeing born as \na Kshatriya was \nimportant in \norder to become \na ruler during this \nperiod? \nFig. 1\nWall relief from Cave \n15, Ellora, showing \nVishnu as Narasimha, \nthe man-lion. \nIt is a work of the \nRashtrakuta period.\n18\n?\nthey often shared power with their \n as well as \nwith associations of peasants, traders and Brahmanas.\nIn each of these states, resources were obtained \nfrom the producers – that is, peasants, cattle-keepers, \nartisans – who were often persuaded or compelled to \nthese were claimed as “rent” due to a lord who asserted \nthat he owned the land. Revenue was also collected \nfrom traders. \nFour hundred taxes!\nThe inscriptions of the Cholas who ruled in Tamil \nNadu refer to more than 400 terms for different kinds \nof taxes. The most frequently mentioned tax is vetti, \ntaken not in cash but in the form of forced labour, and \nkadamai, or land revenue. There were also taxes on \nthatching the house, the use of a ladder to climb palm \ntrees, a cess on succession to family property, etc.  \nAre any such taxes collected today?  \nestablishment, as well as for the construction of temples \n \nturn expected to lead to the acquisition of wealth in the \nform of plunder, and access to land as well as trade routes.\nThe functionaries for collecting revenue were \ngenerally recruited from influential families, and \npositions were often hereditary. This was true about \nthe army as well. In many cases, close relatives of the \nking held these positions.\nPrashastis and Land Grants \ncontain details that may not be literally \ntrue. But they tell us how rulers wanted to depict \nthemselves – as valiant, victorious warriors, for \nexample. These were composed by learned Brahmanas, \nwho occasionally helped in the administration.  \n?\nIn what ways \nwas this form of \nadministration \ndifferent from \nthe present-day \nsystem?\n19\nKINGS AND KINGDOMS\nFig. 2\nThis is a set of copper \nplates recording a \ngrant of land made \nby a ruler in the ninth \ncentury, written partly \nin Sanskrit and partly \nin Tamil.

Why do you \nthink they made \nthese claims?  \n?\nThe “achievements” of Nagabhata\nMany rulers described their achievements in prashastis \n(you read about the prashasti of the Gupta ruler \nSamudragupta last year). \nOne prashasti, written in Sanskrit and found in \nGwalior, Madhya Pradesh, describes the exploits of \nNagabhata, a Pratihara king, as follows:\nThe kings of Andhra, Saindhava (Sind), Vidarbha (part of \nMaharashtra) and Kalinga (part of Orissa) fell before him \neven as he was a prince …\nHe won a victory over Chakrayudha (the ruler of Kanauj) …\nHe defeated the king of Vanga (part of Bengal), Anarta (part \nof Gujarat), Malava (part of Madhya Pradesh), Kirata (forest \npeoples), Turushka (Turks), Vatsa, Matsya (both kingdoms \nin north India) …\nKings often rewarded Brahmanas by grants of land. \nThese were recorded on copper plates, which were given \nto those who received the land.\n20\n?\nWhat was given with the land\nThis is a part of the Tamil section of a land grant given \nby the Cholas: \nWe have demarcated the boundaries of the land by making \nearthen embankments, as well as by planting thorny bushes. \nThis is what the land contains: fruit-bearing trees, water, \nland, gardens and orchards, trees, wells, open spaces, \npasture-land, a village, anthills, platforms, canals, ditches, \nand deep lakes. \nHe who receives the land can collect taxes from it. He can \non betel-leaves, that on woven cloth, as well as on vehicles. \nHe can build large rooms, with upper stories made of baked \nbricks, he can get large and small wells dug, he can plant trees \nand thorny bushes, if necessary, he can get canals constructed \nfor irrigation. He should ensure that water is not wasted, and \nthat embankments are built. \nList all the possible sources of irrigation mentioned \nin the inscription, and discuss how these might \nhave been used.  \n \npoem containing the history of kings who ruled over \nKashmir. It was composed by an author named \nKalhana. He used a variety of sources, including \ninscriptions, documents, eyewitness accounts and \nearlier histories, to write his account. Unlike the \nwriters of \n, he was often critical about rulers \nand their policies.\nWarfare for Wealth \nYou may have noticed that each of these ruling \ntime, they tried to control other areas. One particularly  \n21\nKINGS AND KINGDOMS\n?\nprized area was the city of Kanauj in the Ganga \nvalley. For centuries, rulers belonging to the Gurjara-\nPratihara, Rashtrakuta and Pala dynasties fought for \ncontrol over Kanauj. Because there were three “parties” \nit as the “tripartite struggle”. \nRulers also tried to demonstrate their power and \nresources by building large temples. So, when they \nattacked one another’s kingdoms, they often chose to \ntarget temples, which were sometimes extremely rich.\nOne such ruler is Mahmud of Ghazni, Afghanistan. \nHe raided the subcontinent 17 times (1000–1025) with \na religious motive. His targets were wealthy temples, \nincluding that of Somnath, Gujarat. Much of the wealth \nMahmud carried away was used to create a splendid \ncapital city at Ghazni.\nOther kings who engaged in warfare included the \nChahamanas, later known as the Chauhans, who \nruled over the region around Delhi and Ajmer. They \nattempted to expand their control to the west and \nthe east, where they were opposed by the Chalukyas \nof Gujarat and the Gahadavalas of western Uttar \nPradesh. The Chahamana ruler was Prithviraja III \n(1168 –1192), who defeated a Turk ruler named Sultan \nMuhammad Ghori in 1191, but lost to him the very \nnext year, in 1192. \nA Closer Look: The Cholas \nFrom Uraiyur to Thanjavur \nHow did the Cholas rise to power? A minor  \nchiefly family known as the Muttaraiyar held \npower in the Kaveri delta. They were subordinate \nto the Pallava kings of Kanchipuram. Vijayalaya, \nCholas from Uraiyur, captured the delta from the \nMuttaraiyar in the middle of the ninth century. He \nbuilt the town of Thanjavur and a temple for goddess  \nNishumbhasudini there. \nLook at Map 1 \nagain and \ndiscuss why the \nChahamanas \nmay have wanted \nto expand their \nterritories. \n?\nLook at Map 1 and \nsuggest reasons \nwhy these rulers \nwanted to control \nKanauj and the \nGanga valley. \n22\nThe successors of Vijayalaya conquered neighbouring \nregions and the kingdom grew in size and power. The \nPandyan and the Pallava territories to the south and \nnorth were made part of this kingdom. Rajaraja I, \nconsidered the most powerful Chola ruler, became \nareas. He also reorganised the administration of \nthe empire.

Also look at \nthe elaborate stone \nsculptures used to \ndecorate the outer \nwalls.  \nChola temples often became the nuclei of settlements \nwhich grew around them. These were centres of craft \nproduction. Temples were also endowed with land by \nrulers as well as by others. The produce of this land \nwent into maintaining all the specialists who worked \nat the temple and very often lived near it – priests, \ngarland makers, cooks, sweepers, musicians, dancers, \netc. In other words, temples were not only places of \nworship; they were the centres of economic, social and \ncultural life. \nAmongst the crafts associated with temples, the \nmaking of bronze images was the most distinctive. \nChola bronze images are considered amongst the \nsometimes images were made of devotees as well. \n24\nAgriculture and Irrigation \nMany of the achievements of the Cholas were \nmade possible through new developments in \nthe river Kaveri branches off into several \nsmall channels before emptying into the \nfrequently, depositing fertile soil on \ntheir banks. Water from the channels \nalso provides the necessary moisture \nfor agriculture, particularly the \ncultivation of rice.\nAlthough agriculture had \ndeveloped earlier in other \nparts of Tamil Nadu, it was  \ncentury that this area was opened \nup for large-scale cultivation. \nForests had to be cleared in some \nregions; land had to be levelled in other \nareas. In the delta region, embankments \ncanals had to be constructed to carry \ncrops were grown in a year.\nIn many cases it was necessary to \nwater crops artificially. A variety of \nmethods were used for irrigation. In some \nareas wells were dug. In other places \nhuge tanks were constructed to collect \nrainwater. Remember that irrigation \nworks require planning – organising \nFig. 4\nA Chola bronze sculpture. \nNotice how carefully it is decorated. \n25\nKINGS AND KINGDOMS\nlabour and resources, maintaining these works and \ndeciding on how water is to be shared.

Why do you think there is a difference in the level \nof detail and accuracy between the coastal and inland \nareas in this map?\nMap 2 \nThe subcontinent, from \nthe early-eighteenth- \ncentury Atlas Nouveau \nof Guillaume de l’Isle. \n?\n3\nINTRODUCTION: TRA... \nEqually important is the fact that the science \nof cartography differed in the two periods. When \nhistorians read documents, maps and texts from the \npast, they have to be sensitive to the different historical \nbackgrounds – the \n – in which information \nabout the past was produced.\nNew and Old Terminologies\nIf the context in which information is produced \nchanges with time, what about language and \nmeanings? Historical records exist in a variety of \nlanguages which have changed considerably over \nthe years. Medieval Persian, for example, is different \nfrom modern Persian. The difference is not just with \nregard to grammar and vocabulary; the meanings of \nwords also change over time. \nTake the term “Hindustan”, for example. Today we \nunderstand it as “India”, the modern \n. \nWhen the term was used in the thirteenth century by \nmeant the areas of Punjab, Haryana and the lands \nbetween the Ganga and Yamuna. He used the term \nin a political sense for lands that were a part of the \nthe term never included south India. By contrast, in \nthe early sixteenth century, Babur used Hindustan \nto describe the geography, the fauna and the culture \nof the inhabitants of the subcontinent. As we will see \nlater in the chapter, this was somewhat similar to the \nway the fourteenth-century poet Amir Khusrau used \nthe word “Hind”. While the idea of a geographical \nand cultural entity like “India” did exist, the term \n“Hindustan” did not carry the political and national \nmeanings which we associate with it today. \nHistorians today have to be careful about the terms \nthey use because they meant different things in the \npast. Take, for example, a simple term like “foreigner”. \nIt is used today to mean someone who is not an Indian.  \nCan you think of \nany other words \nwhose meanings \nchange in \ndifferent contexts? \n?\n4\nIn the medieval period, a “foreigner” was any stranger \nwho appeared say in a given village, someone who was \nnot a part of that society or culture. (In Hindi the term \n might be used to describe such a person and \nin Persian, \n.) A city-dweller, therefore, might \nhave regarded a forest-dweller as a “foreigner”, but two \npeasants living in the same village were not foreigners \nto each other, even though they may have had different \nreligious or caste backgrounds.\nHistorians and their Sources\nHistorians use different types of sources to learn about \nthe past depending upon the period of their study \nexample, you read about rulers of the Gupta dynasty \nand Harshavardhana. In this book we will read about \nthe following thousand years, from roughly 700 to 1750. \nYou will notice some continuity in the sources used \nby historians for the study of this period. They still \nrely on coins, inscriptions, architecture and textual \nrecords for information. But there is also considerable \ndiscontinuity. The number and variety of textual records \nincreased dramatically during this period. They slowly \ndisplaced other types of available information. Through \nthis period, paper gradually became cheaper and more  \nThe value of paper\nCompare the following: \n(1) In the middle of the thirteenth century a scholar \nwanted to copy a book. But he did not have enough \npaper. So he washed the writing off a manuscript he \ndid not want, dried the paper and used it. \n(2) A century later, if you bought some food in the \nmarket you could be lucky and have the shopkeeper \nwrap it for you in some paper.\nWhen was paper more expensive and easily available \n– in the thirteenth or the fourteenth century?\n?\n5\nINTRODUCTION: TRA... \nwidely available. People used it to write holy texts, \nchronicles of rulers, letters and teachings of saints, \npetitions and judicial records, and for registers of \naccounts and taxes. Manuscripts were collected by \nwealthy people, rulers, monasteries and temples. They \nwere placed in libraries and archives. These manuscripts \nand documents provide a lot of detailed information to \nThere was no printing press in those days so scribes \ncopied manuscripts by hand. If you have ever copied a \nfriend’s homework you would know that this is not a \nfriend’s handwriting and are forced to guess what is \ndifferences in your copy of your friend’s work. \nManuscript copying is somewhat similar. As scribes \ncopied manuscripts, they also introduced small changes \n – a word here, a sentence there. These small differences \ngrew over centuries of copying until manuscripts of the \nArchive\nA place where \ndocuments and \nmanuscripts are \nstored.

This is a serious problem because we rarely \nare totally dependent upon the copies made by later \nscribes.

At different moments in this period, new \ntechnologies made their appearance – like the Persian \nFig. 2  \nDifferent kinds of \nhandwriting could \nmake the reading of \nPersian and Arabic \nnastaliq \nstyle (on the left) is \ncursive and easy to \nread, the shikaste (on \nthe right) is denser \n7\nINTRODUCTION: TRA... \nwheel in irrigation, the spinning wheel in weaving, and \nin the subcontinent – potatoes, corn, chillies, tea and \ncoffee. Remember that all these innovations – new \ntechnologies and crops – came along with people, who \nbrought other ideas with them as well. As a result, this \nwas a period of economic, political, social and cultural \nchanges. You will learn about some of these changes \nin Chapter 5. \nThis was also a period of great mobility. Groups \nof people travelled long distances in search of \nopportunity. The subcontinent held immense wealth \nand the possibilities for people to carve a fortune. One \ngroup of people who became important in this period \nwere the Rajputs, a name derived from “Rajaputra”, \nthe son of a ruler. Between the eighth and fourteenth \ncenturies, the term was applied more generally to a \ngroup of warriors who claimed Kshatriya caste status. \nFig. 3 \nThe Persian wheel. \n8\n?\nThe term included not just rulers and chieftains but \nalso soldiers and commanders who served in the \narmies of different monarchs all over the subcontinent. \nA chivalric code of conduct – extreme valour and a \ngreat sense of loyalty – were the qualities attributed \nto Rajputs by their poets and bards.

Across most of \nthe subcontinent, the regions were left with the legacies \nof the big and small states that had ruled over them. \nThis was apparent in the emergence of many distinct \nand shared traditions: in the realms of governance, \nthe management of the economy, elite cultures and \nlanguage. Through the thousand years between 700 \nand 1750, the character of the different regions did \nnot grow in isolation. These regions felt the impact of \nlarger pan-regional forces of integration without ever \nquite losing their distinctiveness. \nOld and New Religions\nThe thousand years of history that we are exploring \nwitnessed major developments in religious traditions. \nPeople’s belief in the divine was sometimes deeply \npersonal, but more usually it was collective. Collective \nbelief in a supernatural agency – religion – was often \nclosely connected with the social and economic \norganisation of local communities. As the social worlds \nof these groups altered, so too did their beliefs.\nIt was during this period that important changes \noccurred in what we call Hinduism today. These \nincluded the worship of new deities, the construction \nof temples by royalty and the growing importance of \nBrahmanas, the priests, as dominant groups in society. \nBrahmanas a lot of respect in society. Their dominant \nposition was consolidated by the support of their \npatrons – new rulers searching for prestige.  \nOne of the major developments of this period was the \nemergence of the idea of bhakti – of a loving, personal \ndeity that devotees could reach without the aid of \npriests or elaborate rituals. You will be learning about \nthis, and other traditions, in Chapter 6. \nFind out whether \nand for how long \nyour state was a \npart of these  \npan-regional \nempires. \nDo you remember \nwhat Amir \nKhusrau had to \nsay regarding \nSanskrit, \nknowledge and \nBrahmanas? \nPatron\nwealthy individual \nwho supports \nanother person – \nan artiste, \na craftsperson, a\nlearned man, or \na noble.\n12\nThis was also the period when new religions \nappeared in the subcontinent.

And like Hinduism, \nIslam was interpreted in a variety of ways by its \nthat the Prophet Muhammad’s son-in-law, Ali, was \nthe legitimate leader of the Muslim community, and \nthe early leaders (Khalifas) of the community, and \nthe succeeding Khalifas. There were other important \nand\n \nmystic traditions.\nThinking about Time and                  \nHistorical Periods\nHistorians do not see time just as a passing of hours, \ndays or years – as a clock or a calendar. Time also \nin the persistence and transformation of ideas and \nbeliefs. The study of time is made somewhat easier by \ndividing the past into large segments – periods – that \npossess shared characteristics. \nIn the middle of the nineteenth century, British \nhistorians divided the history of India into three \nperiods: “Hindu”, “Muslim” and “British”.  This division \nwas based on the idea that the religion of rulers was the \nonly important historical change, and that there were \nrich diversity of the subcontinent.  \n13\nINTRODUCTION: TRA... \nFew historians follow this periodisation today. Most \nlook to economic and social factors to characterise \nthe major elements of different moments of the past. \nThe histories you read last year included a wide range \nof early societies – hunter-gatherers, early farmers, \npeople living in towns and villages, and early empires \nand kingdoms. The histories you will be studying this \nmore about the spread of peasant societies, the rise of \nregional and imperial state formations – sometimes at \nthe cost of pastoral and forest people – the development \nof Hinduism and Islam as major religions and the \narrival of European trading companies.  \n These thousand years of Indian history witnessed \nconsiderable change. After all, the sixteenth and \neighteenth centuries were quite different from the \neighth or the eleventh. Therefore, describing the entire \nperiod as one historical unit is not without its problems. \nMoreover, the “medieval” period is often contrasted with \nthe “modern” period. “Modernity” carries with it a sense \nof material progress and intellectual advancement. This \nseems to suggest that the medieval period was lacking \nin any change whatsoever. But of course we know this \nwas not the case.\n During these thousand years, the societies of the \nsubcontinent were transformed often and economies \nin several regions reached a level of prosperity that \nattracted the interest of European trading companies. \nAs you read this book, look out for signs of change \nand the historical processes at work.

Over the centuries important political, \nsocial and economic developments had taken place. \nBut social change was not the same everywhere, \nbecause different kinds of societies evolved \ndifferently. It is important to understand \nhow and why this happened.\nIn large parts of the subcontinent, society \nwas already divided according to the rules \nof \n. These rules, as prescribed by the \nBrahmanas, were accepted by the rulers \nof large kingdoms. The difference between \nthe high and low, and between the rich and \npoor, increased. Under the Delhi Sultans \nand the Mughals, this hierarchy between \nsocial classes grew further. \nBeyond Big Cities: Tribal \nSocieties \nThere were, however, other kinds of \nsocieties as well. Many societies in the \nsubcontinent did not follow the social rules \nand rituals prescribed by the Brahmanas. \nNor were they divided into numerous \nunequal classes. Such societies are often \ncalled tribes. \nTRIBES, NOMADS AND \nSETTLED COMMUNITIES\nFig. 1\nTribal dance, \nSantal painted scroll.\n50\nMembers of each tribe were united by kinship \nbonds. Many tribes obtained their livelihood from \nagriculture. Others were hunter-gatherers or herders. \nMost often they combined these activities to make \nfull use of the natural resources of the area in which \nthey lived. Some tribes were nomadic and moved \nfrom one place to another. A tribal group controlled \nland and pastures jointly, and divided these amongst \nhouseholds according to its own rules. \nMany large tribes thrived in different parts of the \nsubcontinent. They usually lived in forests, hills, \nclashed with the more powerful caste-based societies. \nIn various ways, the tribes retained their freedom and \npreserved their separate culture. \nBut the caste-based and tribal societies also \ndepended on each other for their diverse needs. This \ncaused both societies to change.\nWho were Tribal People? \nContemporary historians and travellers give very \nscanty information about tribes. A few exceptions \napart, tribal people did not keep written records. But \nthey preserved rich customs and oral traditions. These \nwere passed down to each new generation. Present-\nday historians have started using such oral traditions \nto write tribal histories. \nTribal people were found in almost every region of \nvaried at different points of time. Some powerful tribes \ncontrolled large territories. In Punjab, the Khokhar \nfourteenth centuries. Later, the Gakkhars became \nmore important. Their chief, Kamal Khan Gakkhar, \nwas made a noble (\n) by Emperor Akbar. In \nMultan and Sind, the Langahs and Arghuns dominated \nextensive regions before they were subdued by the \nMughals. The Balochis were another large and powerful \nOn a physical \nmap of the \nsubcontinent, \nidentify the areas \nin which tribal \npeople may have \nlived.\n?\n51\nTRIBES, NOMADS AND\nSETTLED COMMUNITIES\ntribe in the north-west. They were divided into many \nsmaller clans under different chiefs. In the western \nHimalaya lived the shepherd tribe of Gaddis. The \ndistant north-eastern part of the subcontinent too was \nentirely dominated by tribes – the Nagas, Ahoms and \nmany others.\nIn many areas of present-day Bihar and Jharkhand, \nChero chiefdoms had emerged by the twelfth century. \nRaja Man Singh, Akbar’s famous general, attacked \nand defeated the Cheros in 1591. A large amount of \nbooty was taken from them, but they were not entirely \nsubdued. Under Aurangzeb, Mughal forces captured \nmany Chero fortresses and subjugated the tribe. The \nMundas and Santals were among the other important \ntribes that lived in this region and also in Orissa  \nand Bengal. \nMap 1\nLocation of some \nof the major Indian \ntribes.\nClan\n52\nThe Maharashtra highlands and \nKarnataka were home to Kolis, \nBerads and numerous others. \nKolis also lived in many areas of \nGujarat. Further south there were \nlarge tribal populations of Koragas, \nVetars, Maravars and many others.\nThe large tribe of Bhils was \nspread across western and central \nIndia. By the late sixteenth \ncentury, many of them had \nbecome settled agriculturists and \nsome even zamindars. Many Bhil \nclans, nevertheless, remained  \nhunter-gatherers. The Gonds were \nfound in great numbers across the \npresent-day states of Chhattisgarh, \nMadhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and \nAndhra Pradesh.\nHow Nomads and \nMobile People Lived\nNomadic pastoralists moved \nover long distances with their \nanimals. They lived on milk and \nother pastoral products. They also \nexchanged wool, ghee, etc., with \nsettled agriculturists for grain, \ncloth, utensils and other products. \nFig. 2\nBhils hunting deer by night.\nFig.3\nA chain of mobile traders connected \nIndia to the outside world. Here you see \nnuts being gathered and loaded on the \nbacks of camels. Central Asian traders \nbrought such goods to India and the \nBanjaras and other traders carried \nthese to local markets.\n53\nTRIBES, NOMADS AND\nSETTLED COMMUNITIES\nThey bought and sold these goods as they moved \nfrom one place to another, transporting them on their \nanimals.\nThe Banjaras were the most important trader-\nnomads. Their caravan was called \n. Sultan \nAlauddin Khalji (Chapter 3) used the Banjaras to \ntransport grain to the city markets. Emperor Jahangir \nwrote in his memoirs that the Banjaras carried grain \non their bullocks from different areas and sold it in \ntowns. They transported food grain for the Mughal \narmy during military campaigns. With a large army \nthere could be 100,000 bullocks carrying grain.\nThe Banjaras\nPeter Mundy, an English trader who came to India \nduring the early seventeenth century, has described \nthe Banjaras:\n In the morning we met a tanda of Banjaras with 14,000 \noxen. They were all laden with grains such as wheat and \nrice ... These Banjaras carry their household – wives and \nchildren – along with them. One tanda consists of many \nfamilies. Their way of life is similar to that of carriers who \ncontinuously travel from place to place. They own their oxen. \nThey are sometimes hired by merchants, but most commonly \nthey are themselves merchants. They buy grain where it is \ncheaply available and carry it to places where it is dearer. \nFrom there, they again reload their oxen with anything that \nmore than 6 or 7 miles a day – that, too, in the cool weather. \nAfter unloading their oxen, they turn them free to graze as \nthere is enough land here, and no one there to forbid them.\nFind out how grain is transported from villages \nto cities at present. In what ways is this similar \nto or different from the ways in which the  \nBanjaras functioned? \n?\nNomads and \nitinerant groups\n54\nMany pastoral tribes reared and sold animals, \nsuch as cattle and horses, to the prosperous people. \nDifferent castes of petty pedlars \nalso travelled from village to \nvillage. They made and \nsold wares such as ropes, \nreeds, straw matting and \ncoarse sacks. Sometimes \nmendicants acted as \nwandering merchants. There \nwere castes of entertainers who performed in different \ntowns and villages for their livelihood. \nChanging Society: New Castes and \nHierarchies\nAs the economy and the needs of society grew, people \nwith new skills were required. Smaller castes, or \n, emerged within \n. For example, new castes \nappeared amongst the Brahmanas. On the other  \nhand, many tribes and social groups were taken \ninto caste-based society and given the status of \n. Specialised artisans – smiths, carpenters and \nmasons – were also recognised as separate \n by \nthe Brahmanas. \n, rather than \n, became the \nbasis for organising society.\nDeliberations on jati \nA twelfth-century inscription from Uyyakondan Udaiyar, \nin Tiruchirapalli taluka (in present-day Tamil Nadu), \ndescribes the deliberations in a sabha (Chapter 2) of \nBrahmanas. \nThey deliberated on the status of a group known as \nrathakaras (literally, chariot makers). They laid down \ntheir occupations, which were to include architecture, \nbuilding coaches and chariots, erecting gateways \nfor temples with images in them, preparing wooden \nequipment used to perform sacrifices, building \nmandapas, making jewels for the king. \nFig. 4\nBronze crocodile, \nKutiya Kond tribe, \nOrissa.\n55\nTRIBES, NOMADS AND\nSETTLED COMMUNITIES\nAmong the Kshatriyas, new Rajput clans became \npowerful by the eleventh and twelfth centuries. \nThey belonged to different lineages, such as Hunas, \nChandelas, Chalukyas and others. Some of these, too, \nhad been tribes earlier. Many of these clans came to \nbe regarded as Rajputs. They gradually replaced the \nolder rulers, especially in agricultural areas. Here a \ndeveloped society was emerging, and rulers used their \nwealth to create powerful states. \nThe rise of Rajput clans to the position of rulers set \nan example for the tribal people to follow. Gradually, \nwith the support of the Brahmanas, many tribes \nbecame a part of the caste system. But only the leading \ntribal families could join the ruling class. A large \nmajority joined the lower \n of caste society. On the \nother hand, many dominant tribes of Punjab, Sind and \nthe North-West Frontier had adopted Islam quite early. \nThey continued to reject the caste system. The unequal \nsocial order, prescribed by orthodox Hinduism, was \nnot widely accepted in these areas. \nThe emergence of states is closely related to social \nchange amongst tribal people. Two examples of this \nimportant part of our history are described below.\nA Closer Look\nThe Gonds\nThe Gonds lived in a vast forested region called \nGondwana – or “country inhabited by Gonds”. They \npractised shifting cultivation. The large Gond tribe \nwas further divided into many smaller clans. Each clan \nhad its own raja or \n. About the time that the power \nof the Delhi Sultans was declining, a few large Gond \nkingdoms were beginning to dominate the smaller \nGond chiefs. The \n, a history of Akbar’s \nreign, mentions the Gond kingdom of Garha Katanga \nthat had 70,000 villages. \nThe administrative system of these kingdoms was \nbecoming centralised. The kingdom was divided into \nShifting \ncultivation\nFig. 5\nA Gond woman.\n56\nMap 2\nGondwana.\nFig. 6\nA carved door. \nGond tribe, Bastar \narea, Madhya \nPradesh.\n. Each \n was controlled \nby a particular Gond clan. This \nwas further divided into units of \n84 villages called \n. The \n was subdivided into \n which were made up of \n12 villages each.\nThe emergence of large states \nchanged the nature of Gond \nsociety. Their basically equal \nsociety gradually got divided   \ninto unequal social classes. \nBrahmanas received land grants \nfrom the Gond rajas and became \nnow wished to be recognised \nas Rajputs. So, Aman Das, the \nGond raja of Garha Katanga, \nassumed the title of Sangram \nShah. His son, Dalpat, married \nprincess Durgawati, the daughter of Salbahan, the \nChandel Rajput raja of Mahoba. \nDalpat, however, died early. Rani Durgawati was very \nher, the kingdom became \neven more extensive. In \n1565, the Mughal forces \nunder Asaf Khan attacked \nGarha Katanga. A strong \nresistance was put up by Rani \nDurgawati.  She was defeated \nand preferred to die rather \nthan surrender. Her son, too, \nGarha Katanga was a rich \nstate. It earned much wealth \nby trapping and exporting wild \nelephants to other kingdoms. \nWhen the Mughals defeated \n57\nTRIBES, NOMADS AND\nSETTLED COMMUNITIES\nthe Gonds, they captured a huge booty \nof precious coins and elephants. They \nannexed part of the kingdom and granted \nthe rest to Chandra Shah, an uncle of Bir \nNarain. Despite the fall of Garha Katanga, \nthe Gond kingdoms survived for some \ntime. However, they became much weaker \nand later struggled unsuccessfully against \nthe stronger Bundelas and Marathas. \nThe Ahoms\nThe Ahoms migrated to the Brahmaputra \nvalley from present-day Myanmar in the \nthirteenth century. They created a new \nstate by suppressing the older political \nsystem of the \n (landlords). \nDuring the sixteenth century, they \nannexed the kingdoms of the Chhutiyas \n(1523) and of Koch-Hajo (1581) and \nsubjugated many other tribes. The \nAhoms built a large state, and for this \nquality gunpowder and cannons.\nHowever, the Ahoms faced many \ninvasions from the south-west. In 1662, \nthe Mughals under Mir Jumla attacked \nthe Ahom kingdom. Despite their brave \ndefence, the Ahoms were defeated. But \ndirect Mughal control over the region \ncould not last long. \nThe Ahom state depended upon forced \nlabour. Those forced to work for the \nstate were called \n. A census of the \npopulation was taken. Each village had \nto send a number of \n by rotation. \nPeople from heavily populated areas \nwere shifted to less populated places. \nAhom clans were thus broken up. By the \nadministration became quite centralised.\nMap 3\nTribes of eastern India.\nLachit Barphukan and the \ndefeat of the Mughals in Assam\n58\nAlmost all adult males served in the army during \nwar. At other times, they were engaged in building \ndams, irrigation systems and other public works. The \nAhoms also introduced new methods of rice cultivation.\nAhom society was divided into clans or \n. There \nwere very few castes of artisans, so artisans in the \nAhom areas came from the adjoining kingdoms. A \n \noften controlled several villages. The peasant was given \nland by his village community. Even the king could not \ntake it away without the community’s consent.\nOriginally, the Ahoms worshipped their own tribal \nhowever, the influence of Brahmanas increased. \nTemples and Brahmanas were granted land by the \nking.

This interaction caused both kinds of societies \nto adapt and change. There were many different tribes \nand they took up diverse livelihoods. Over a period of \ntime, many of them merged with caste-based society. \nOthers, however, rejected both the caste system and \northodox Hinduism.

Quite in contrast to their predecessors, \nthe Mughals created an empire and accomplished what \nhad hitherto seemed possible for only short periods \nof time. From the latter half of the sixteenth century, \nthey expanded their kingdom from Agra and Delhi, \nuntil in the seventeenth century they controlled nearly \nall of the subcontinent. They imposed structures of \nadministration and ideas of governance that outlasted \ntheir rule, leaving a political legacy that succeeding \nrulers of the subcontinent could not ignore. Today \nthe Prime Minister of India addresses the nation on \nIndependence Day from the ramparts of the Red Fort \nin Delhi, the residence of the Mughal emperors. \nTHE MUGHALS  \n(16th TO 17th CENTURY)\nFig. 1\nThe Red Fort.\n40\nFig. 2\nMughal army on \ncampaign. \nFig. 3\nCannons were an \nimportant addition \nin sixteenth-century \nwarfare.

From their father’s side, they \nwere the successors of Timur (died \n1404), the ruler of Iran, Iraq and  \nmodern-day Turkey. However, \nthe Mughals did not like to be \ncalled Mughal or Mongol. This was \nbecause Genghis Khan’s memory \nwas associated with the massacre \nof innumerable people. It was also \nlinked with the Uzbegs, their Mongol \ncompetitors. On the other hand, the \nMughals were proud of their Timurid \nancestry, not least of all because \ntheir great ancestor had captured \nThey celebrated their genealogy \npictorially, each ruler getting a \npicture made of Timur and himself. \nMughal Military Campaigns \nhe was only 12 years old. He \nwas forced to leave his ancestral \nthrone due to the invasion of \nanother Mongol group, the Uzbegs. \nAfter years of wandering, he \nseized Kabul in 1504. In 1526 he  \n \nand Agra. \n41\nTHE MUGHALS\nMughal Traditions of Succession \nThe Mughals did not believe in the rule of primogeniture, \nwhere the eldest son inherited his father’s estate. \nInstead they followed the Mughal and Timurid \ncustom of coparcenary inheritance, or a division of \nthe inheritance amongst all the sons. Which do you \nthink is a fairer division of inheritance: primogeniture \nor coparcenary?\nMughal Relations with Other Rulers\nThe Mughal rulers campaigned constantly against \nrulers who refused to accept their authority. But as \nthe Mughals became powerful many other rulers \nalso joined them voluntarily. The Rajputs are a good \nexample of this. Many of them married their daughters \ninto Mughal families and received high positions. But \nmany resisted as well. \nMughal marriages \nwith the Rajputs \nThe mother of \nJahangir was                   \na Kachhwaha \nprincess, daughter \nof the Rajput \nruler of Amber \n(modern- day \nJaipur). The \nmother of Shah \nJahan was a Rathor \nprincess, daughter \nof the Rajput \nruler of Marwar \n(Jodhpur).\nMap 1\nMilitary campaigns \nunder Akbar and \nAurangzeb.\n42\nZat ranking \nNobles with a \nzat of 5,000 \nwere ranked \nhigher than \nthose of 1,000. \nIn Akbar’s reign                \nthere were 29 \nmansabdars \nwith a rank of \n5,000 zat; by \nAurangzeb’s \nreign the number \nof mansabdars           \nhad increased to \n79. Would this \nhave meant more \nexpenditure for          \nthe state? \nMughal authority for a long time. Once defeated, \nhowever, they were honourably treated by the Mughals, \ngiven their lands \n back as assignments  \n. The careful balance between defeating \nbut not humiliating their opponents enabled the \n \nthe time. \nMansabdars and Jagirdars\nAs the empire expanded to encompass different \nregions, the Mughals recruited diverse bodies of \npeople. From a small nucleus of Turkish nobles \n(Turanis) they expanded to include Iranians, Indian \nMuslims, Afghans, Rajputs, Marathas and other \ngroups. Those who joined Mughal service were \nenrolled as \n.\nThe term \n refers to an individual who \nholds a \n, meaning a position or rank. It was \nand salary were determined by a numerical value  \ncalled \n. The higher the \n, the more prestigious \nwas the noble’s position in court and the larger  \nhis salary.\nThe \n military responsibilities \nrequired him to maintain a specified number of \n or cavalrymen. The \n brought his \ncavalrymen for review, got them registered, their \nhorses branded and then received money to pay them \nas salary.\n received their salaries as revenue \nassignments called \n which were somewhat like \n. But unlike \n, most \n did not \nactually reside in or administer their\n. They only \nhad rights to the revenue of their assignments which \nwas collected for them by their servants while the  \nthemselves served in some other part of \nthe country. \n43\nTHE MUGHALS\nIn Akbar’s reign, these \n were carefully assessed \nso that their revenues were \nroughly equal to the salary \nof the \n. By \nAurangzeb’s reign, this was \nno longer the case and the \nactual revenue collected was \noften less than the granted \nsum. There was also a huge \nincrease in the number of \n which meant a \nlong wait before they received a \n. These and other \nfactors created a shortage in the number of \n. \nAs a result, many \n tried to extract as much \nrevenue as possible while they had a \n. Aurangzeb \nwas unable to control these developments in the \nlast years of his reign and the peasantry therefore  \nsuffered tremendously. \nZabt and Zamindars \nThe main source of income available to Mughal \nrulers was tax on the produce of the peasantry. In \nmost places, peasants paid taxes through the rural \nelites, that is, the headman or the local chieftain. The \nMughals used one term – zamindars – to describe all \nintermediaries, whether they were local headmen \nof villages or powerful chieftains.\nAkbar’s revenue minister, Todar Mal, carried \nout a careful survey of crop yields, prices \nand areas cultivated for a 10-year period, \nwas divided into revenue circles with its own \nschedule of revenue rates for individual crops. \nThis revenue system was known as \n. It \nwas prevalent in those areas where Mughal \nadministrators could survey the land and keep \nvery careful accounts. This was not possible in  \nprovinces, such as Gujarat and Bengal. \nFig. 4\nA mansabdar on \nmarch with his \nsawars. \nFig. 5\nDetails from a \nminiature from \nShah Jahan’s reign \ndepicting corruption \nin his father’s \nadministration:\nreceiving a bribe and  \n(2) a tax-collector \npunishing poor \npeasants.\n44\nIn some areas, the zamindars exercised a great deal \nof power. The exploitation by Mughal administrators \nand peasants of the same caste allied in rebelling \nagainst Mughal authority. These peasant revolts \nchallenged the stability of the Mughal Empire from \nthe end of the seventeenth century.\nFig. 6\nAkbar recieving the Akbar Nama \nfrom Abul Fazl.\nMehrunnisa married the Emperor Jahangir \nin 1611 and received the title Nur Jahan. She \nremained extremely loyal and supportive \nto the monarch. As a mark of honour, \nJahangir struck silver coins bearing his \nown titles on one side and on the other \nthe inscription “struck in the name of the \nQueen Begum, Nur Jahan”. \nThe adjoining document is an order \n(farman) of Nur Jahan. The square seal \nstates, “Command of her most Sublime and \nElevated Majesty Nur Jahan Padshah Begum”. \nThe round seal states, “by the sun of Shah \nJahangir she became as brilliant as the moon; may Nur \nJahan Padshah be the lady of the age”.\nFig. 7\nNur Jahan’s farman. \n Akbar Nama and Ain-i Akbari\nAkbar ordered one of his close friends and \ncourtiers, Abul Fazl, to write a history of \nhis reign. Abul Fazl wrote a three-volume \nhistory of Akbar’s reign, titled Akbar \nNama. The first volume dealt with Akbar’s \nancestors and the second volume recorded \nthe events of Akbar’s reign. The third \nvolume is the Ain-i Akbari. It deals with \nAkbar’s administration, household, army, \nthe revenues and the geography of his \nempire. It also provides rich details about \nthe traditions and culture of the people \nliving in India. The most interesting aspect \nabout the Ain-i Akbari is its rich statistical \ndetails about things as diverse as crops, \nyields, prices, wages and revenues.\nNur Jahan’s influence in Jahangir’s court\n45\nTHE MUGHALS\nSulh-i kul\nJahangir, Akbar’s son, described his father’s policy of \nsulh-i kul in the following words: \nAs in the wide expanse of the divine compassion there is room \nfor all classes and the followers of all creeds, so … in his \nImperial dominions, which on all sides were limited only by \nthe sea, there was room for the professors of opposite religions, \nand for beliefs, good and bad, and the road to intolerance was \nclosed. Sunnis and Shias met in one mosque and Christians \nand Jews in one church to pray. He consistently followed the \nprinciple of “universal peace” (sulh-i kul).\nThe Mughal Empire in the Seventeenth \nCentury and After\nThe administrative and military efficiency of the \nMughal Empire led to great economic and commercial \nprosperity. International travellers described it as the \nfabled land of wealth. But these same visitors were \nalso appalled at the state of poverty that existed side \nby side with the greatest opulence.

But the \nscale of revenue collection left very little for investment \nin the hands of the primary producers – the peasant \nand the artisan.

The wealthier peasantry and \nin this economic world.\nThe enormous wealth and resources commanded \nby the Mughal elite made them an extremely powerful \ngroup of people in the late seventeenth century. As the \nauthority of the Mughal emperor slowly declined, his \nservants emerged as powerful centres of power in the \nregions.

Such \nintense devotion or love of God is the legacy of various \nsince the eighth century.\nThe Idea of a Supreme God\nBefore large kingdoms emerged, different groups   \nof people worshipped their own gods and goddesses. \nAs people were brought together through the growth \nof towns, trade and empires, new ideas began to \ndevelop. The idea that all living things pass through \ncountless cycles of birth and rebirth performing good \ndeeds and bad came to be widely accepted. Similarly, \nthe idea that all human beings are not equal even at \nbirth gained ground during this period. The belief that \nsocial privileges came from birth in a “noble” family or \na “high” caste was the subject of many learned texts.\nMany people were uneasy with such ideas and \nturned to the teachings of the Buddha or the Jainas \naccording to which it was possible to overcome social \ndifferences and break the cycle of rebirth through \npersonal effort. Others felt attracted to the idea of a \nSupreme God who could deliver humans from such \nbondage if approached with devotion (or bhakti). \nThis idea, advocated in the \n grew in \npopularity in the early centuries of the Common Era.  \nDEVOTIONAL PATHS \nTO THE DIVINE\nThe beginning of \nBhakti\nWorship of certain \ndeities, which \nbecame a central \nfeature of later \nHinduism, gained in \nimportance.

Bhakti is \ngenerally understood \nas a person’s \ndevotion to his or \nher chosen deity. \nAnybody, whether \nrich or poor, belonging \nto the so-called ‘high’ \nor ‘low’ castes, man \nor woman, could \nfollow the path of \nBhakti. The idea of \nBhakti is present in \nthe Bhagavad Gita, a \nsacred book of  \nthe Hindus. \n62\nShiva, Vishnu and \nDurga as supreme \ndeities came to   \nbe worshipped \nthrough elaborate \nrituals. At the \nsame time, gods \nand goddesses \nw or shi pped  in \ndifferent areas \nc a m e  \nt o  \nb e \nidentified with \nShi va, Vish n u \nor Durga. In the \nprocess, local myths and legends became a part of the \nPuranic stories, and methods of worship recommended \nin the Puranas were introduced into the local cults. \nEventually the Puranas also laid down that it was \npossible for devotees to receive the grace of God \nregardless of their caste status. The idea of bhakti \nbecame so popular that even Buddhists and Jainas \nadopted these beliefs.\nBhakti in South India –  \nNayanars and Alvars\nThe seventh to ninth centuries saw the emergence of \nnew religious movements, led by the Nayanars (saints \ndevoted to Shiva) and Alvars (saints devoted to Vishnu) \nwho came from all castes including those considered \n“untouchable” like the Pulaiyar and the Panars. They \nwere sharply critical of the Buddhists and Jainas \nand preached ardent love of Shiva or Vishnu as the \npath to salvation. They drew upon the ideals of love \nand heroism as found in the Sangam literature (the \nearliest example of Tamil literature, composed during \nthe early centuries of the Common Era) and blended \nthem with the values of bhakti. The Nayanars and \nAlvars went from place to place composing exquisite \npoems in praise of the deities enshrined in the villages \nthey visited, and set them to music.\nYou can observe \nthis process of \nlocal myths and \nlegends receiving \nwider acceptance \neven today. Can \nyou find some \nexamples \naround you? \nFig. 1\nA page from a south \nIndian manuscript of \nthe Bhagavad Gita.\n?\n63\nDEVOTIONAL PATHS\nTO THE DIVINE\nNayanars and Alvars\nThere were 63 Nayanars, who belonged to different \nsocial backgrounds, such as potters, “untouchable” \nworkers, peasants, hunters, soldiers, Brahmanas and \nchiefs. The best known among them were Appar, \nSambandar, Sundarar and Manikkavasagar. There are \ntwo sets of compilations of their songs – Tevaram and \nTiruvacakam. \nThere were 12 Alvars, who came from equally  \ndivergent backgrounds, the best known being \nPeriyalvar, his daughter Andal, Tondaradippodi Alvar \nand Nammalvar. Their songs were compiled in the Divya \nPrabandham.\nBetween the tenth and twelfth centuries, the Chola \nand Pandya kings built elaborate temples around many \nof the shrines visited by the saint-poets, strengthening \nthe links between the bhakti tradition and temple \nworship. This was also the time when their poems \nwere compiled. Besides, hagiographies or religious \nbiographies of the Alvars and Nayanars were also \ncomposed. Today we use these texts as sources for \nwriting histories of the bhakti tradition. \nThe devotee and the Lord\nThis is a composition of Manikkavasagar: \nHow does the poet describe his relationship  \nwith the deity? \nHagiography \n?\nFig. 2\nA bronze image of \nManikkavasagar.\n64\n?\nPhilosophy and Bhakti \nof India, was born in Kerala in the eighth century. \nHe was an advocate of Advaita or the doctrine of \nthe oneness of the individual soul and the Supreme \nGod which is the Ultimate Reality. He taught that \nBrahman, the only or Ultimate Reality, was formless \nand without any attributes. He considered the world \naround us to be an illusion or \n, and preached \nrenunciation of the world and adoption of the path of \nknowledge to understand the true nature of Brahman \nand attain salvation.  \nRamanuja, born in Tamil Nadu in the eleventh \ncentury, was deeply influenced by the Alvars. \nAccording to him the best means of attaining \nsalvation was through intense devotion to Vishnu. \nVishnu in His grace helps the devotee to attain the \nbliss of union with Him. He propounded the doctrine \neven when united with the Supreme God remained \ndistinct. Ramanuja’s doctrine greatly inspired the \nnew strand of bhakti which developed in north  \nIndia subsequently.  \nBasavanna’s Virashaivism\nWe noted earlier the connection between the Tamil \nbhakti movement and temple worship. This in turn \nled to a reaction that is best represented in the \nVirashaiva movement initiated by Basavanna and his \ncompanions like Allama Prabhu and Akkamahadevi. \nThis movement began in Karnataka in the  \nmid-twelfth century. The Virashaivas argued strongly \nfor the equality of all human beings and against \nBrahmanical ideas about caste and the treatment of \nwomen. They were also against all forms of ritual and \nidol worship. \nTry and find out \nmore about the \nideas of Shankara \nor Ramanuja.\n65\nDEVOTIONAL PATHS\nTO THE DIVINE\n?\nVirashaiva vachanas\nThese are vachanas or sayings attributed to Basavanna:\nThe rich,\nWill make temples for Shiva.\nWhat shall I, \nA poor man,\nDo?\nMy legs are pillars,\nThe body the shrine,\nThe head a cupola\nOf gold.\nListen, O Lord of the meeting rivers,\nThings standing shall fall,\nBut the moving ever shall stay.\nWhat is the temple that Basavanna is offering to God?\nBhakti Movement in the Decean\nFrom the thirteenth to the seventeenth centuries, \nMaharashtra saw a great number of saint-poets, whose \nsongs in simple Marathi continue to inspire people. \nThe most important among them were Dnyaneshwar \n(Gyaneshwar), Namdev, Eknath and Tukaram as well \nas women like Sakhubai and the family of Chokhamela, \nwho belonged to the “untouchable” Mahar caste. This \nregional tradition of bhakti focused on the Vitthala (a \nform of Vishnu) temple in Pandharpur, as well as on \nthe notion of a personal god residing in the hearts of \nall people. \nThese saint-poets rejected all forms of ritualism, \noutward display of piety and social differences \nbased on birth. In fact, they even rejected the idea of \nrenunciation and preferred to live with their families, \nearning their livelihood like any other person, while \nhumbly serving fellow human beings in need. A new \nhumanist idea emerged as they insisted that bhakti \n66\nlay in sharing others’ pain. As the famous Gujarati \nsaint Narsi Mehta said, “They are Vaishnavas who \nunderstand the pain of others.”\nQuestioning the social order\nThis is an abhang (Marathi devotional hymn) of Sant \nTukaram: \nwith the battered and the beaten\nMark him as a saint\nFor God is with him\nHe holds\nEvery forsaken man\nClose to his heart \nHe treats \nA slave\nAs his own son\nSays Tuka\nI won’t be tired \nto repeat again\nSuch a man\nIs God \nIn person.\n Here is an abhang composed by Chokhamela’s son:\nYou made us low caste,\nWhy don’t you face that fact, Great Lord?\nOur whole life – left-over food to eat.\nYou should be ashamed of this.\nYou have eaten in our home.\nHow can you deny it?\nChokha’s (son) Karmamela asks\nWhy did you give me life?\nDiscuss the ideas about the social order expressed \nin these compositions. \n?\n67\nDEVOTIONAL PATHS\nTO THE DIVINE\nNathpanthis, Siddhas and Yogis\nA number of religious groups that \nemerged during this period criticised the \nritual and other aspects of conventional \nreligion and the social order, using \nsimple, logical arguments. Among them \nwere the Nathpanthis, Siddhacharas \nand Yogis. They advocated renunciation \nof the world. To them the path to \nsalvation lay in meditation on the \nformless Ultimate Reality and the \nrealisation of oneness with it. To achieve \nthis, they advocated intense training of \nthe mind and body through practices \nlike \n, breathing exercises \nand meditation. These groups became \nparticularly popular among “low” castes. \nTheir criticism of conventional religion \ncreated the ground for devotional \nreligion to become a popular force in \nnorthern India.\nIslam and Sufism\nThe \nmuch so that it is believed that they adopted many \nrejected outward religiosity and emphasised love and \ndevotion to God and compassion towards all fellow \nhuman beings. \nIslam propagated strict monotheism or submission \nto one God.

I asked about him from Avicenna \nlooked into my heart. In that, his place, I saw him. He was \nin no other place.\nNew Religious Developments in  \nNorth India\nThe period after the thirteenth century saw \na new wave of the bhakti movement in North \nIndia. This was an age when Islam, Brahmanical \nanother. We saw that new kingdoms (Chapters 2, 3  \nand 4) were emerging, and people were taking up new \npeople, especially craftspersons, peasants, traders and \nlabourers, thronged to listen to these \nnew saints and spread their ideas.\nSome of them like Kabir and Baba \nGuru Nanak rejected all orthodox \nreligions. Others like Tulsidas and \nSurdas accepted existing beliefs  \nand practices but wanted to make \nthese accessible to all. Tulsidas \nconceived of God in the form of \nRama. Tulsidas’s composition, the \n written in Awadhi \n(a language used in eastern Uttar \nPradesh), is important both as an \nFig. 7\nChaitanyadeva, a \nsixteenth-century \nbhakti saint from \nBengal, preached \nKrishna-Radha.

Surdas \nwas an ardent devotee of Krishna. His compositions, \ncompiled in the \n, \n and \n, express his devotion. Also contemporary was \nemphasised devotion to Vishnu, and composed poems \nand plays in Assamese. He began the practice of setting \nup \n or houses of recitation and prayer, a \npractice that continues to date.\nThis tradition also included saints like Dadu Dayal, \nRavidas and Mirabai. Mirabai was a Rajput princess \nmarried into the royal family of Mewar in the sixteenth \ncentury. Mirabai became a disciple of Ravidas, a saint \nfrom a caste considered “untouchable”. She was \nMap 1\nMajor bhakti saints \nand the regions \nassociated with them.\nEka \nSarana Nama \nDharma\nBhagavad Gita\nBhagavata \nPurana\nsatra \n \nKirtana-ghosha\n72\ndevoted to Krishna and composed innumerable \nexpressing her intense devotion. Her songs \nalso openly challenged the norms of the “upper” castes \nand became popular with the masses in Rajasthan \nand Gujarat.\nA unique feature of most of the saints is that their \nworks were composed in regional languages and could \nbe sung. They became immensely popular and were \nhanded down orally from generation to generation. \nUsually the poorest, most deprived communities and \nwomen transmitted these songs, often adding their own \nexperiences. Thus the songs as we have them today are \nas much a creation of the saints as of generations of \npeople who sang them. They have become a part of our \nliving popular culture. \nFig. 8\nMirabai.\nBeyond the Rana’s palace\nThis is a song composed by Mirabai: \nRanaji, I have left your norms of shame,\nand false decorum of the princely life.\nI have left your town.\nAnd yet Rana why have you kept up                             \nenmity against me?\nRana you gave me a cup of poison.\nI drank it laughing. \nRana I will not be destroyed by you.\nAnd yet Rana why have you kept up                                    \nenmity against me?\nWhy do you think Mirabai left the                           \nRana’s palace? \n?\nGita Govinda \nraga\ntala\nbhajan, \nkirtan\nabhang\n73\nDEVOTIONAL PATHS\nTO THE DIVINE\nA Closer Look: Kabir\nwas brought up in a family of Muslim \n or weavers \nsettled in or near the city of Benares (Varanasi). We \nhave little reliable information about his life. We get \nto know of his ideas from a vast collection of verses \ncalled \n and \n said to have been composed \nby him and sung by wandering \nsingers. Some \nof these were later collected and preserved in the \n \n and \n.\nIn search of the True Lord\nHere is a composition of Kabir: \nO Allah-Ram present in all living beings\nHave mercy on your servants, O Lord!\nWhy bump your head on the ground,\nWhy bathe your body in water?\nYou kill and you call yourself “humble”\nBut your vices you conceal.\nTwenty-four times the Brahmana keeps \nthe ekadasi fast\nWhile the Qazi observes the Ramzan\nTell me why does he set aside the eleven \nmonths \nTo seek spiritual fruit in the twelfth?\nHari dwells in the East, they say\nAnd Allah resides in the West,\nSearch for him in your heart, in the heart \nof your heart;\nThere he dwells, Rahim-Ram.\nIn what ways are the ideas in this poem similar \nto or different from those of Basavanna and  \nJalaluddin Rumi?\nFig. 9\nKabir working on \na loom.\n?\n74\nKabir’s teachings were based on a complete, indeed \nvehement, rejection of the major religious traditions. \nHis teachings openly ridiculed all forms of external \nworship of both Brahmanical Hinduism and Islam, \nthe pre-eminence of the priestly classes and the caste \nsystem. The language of his poetry was a form of \nspoken Hindi widely understood by ordinary people. \nHe also sometimes used cryptic language, which is \nKabir believed in a formless Supreme God and \npreached that the only path to salvation was through \nbhakti or devotion. Kabir drew his followers from \namong both Hindus and Muslims.\nA Closer Look: Baba Guru Nanak\nWe know more about Baba Guru Nanak (1469-1539) \nthan about Kabir. Born at Talwandi (Nankana Sahib \nin Pakistan), he travelled widely before establishing a \ncentre at Kartarpur (Dera Baba Nanak on the river Ravi). \nA regular worship that consisted of the singing of his \nown hymns was established there for his followers. \nIrrespective of their former \ncreed, caste or gender, his \nfollowers ate together in the \ncommon kitchen (\nThe \nsacred space thus created by \nBaba Guru Nanak was known \nas \n. It is now known \nas Gurdwara.\nBefore his death in 1539, \nBaba Guru Nanak appointed \none of his followers as his \nsuccessor. His name was Lehna \nbut he came to be known as \nGuru Angad, signifying that  \nhe was a part of Baba Guru \nNanak himself. Guru Angad \ncompiled the compositions  \nof Baba Guru Nanak, to  \nwhich he added his own in  \nFig. 10\nBaba Guru Nanak \nas a young man, in \ndiscussion with \nholy men.\n75\nDEVOTIONAL PATHS\nTO THE DIVINE\na new script known as Gurmukhi. \nThe three successors of Guru Angad \nalso wrote under the name of “Nanak” \nand all of their compositions were \ncompiled by Guru Arjan in 1604. To this \ncompilation were added the writings of \nKabir, Bhagat Namdev and Guru Tegh \nBahadur. In 1706, this compilation was \nauthenticated by Guru Tegh Bahadur’s \nson and successor, Guru Gobind Singh. \nIt is now known as \n, \nthe holy scripture of the Sikhs.\nThe number of Baba Guru Nanak’s \nfollowers increased through the sixteenth century \nunder his successors. They belonged to a number \nof castes but traders, agriculturists, artisans and \ncraftsmen predominated. This may have something \nto do with Baba Guru Nanak’s insistence that his \nfollowers must be householders and should adopt \nproductive and useful occupations. They were also \nexpected to contribute to the general funds of the \ncommunity of followers. \nBy the beginning of the seventeenth century, the \ntown of Ramdaspur (Amritsar) had developed around \nthe central Gurdwara called Harmandar Sahib (Golden \nTemple). It was virtually self-governing and modern \nhistorians refer to the early-seventeenth-century Sikh \ncommunity as ‘a state within the state’. The Mughal \nemperor Jahangir looked upon them as a potential \nthreat and he ordered the execution of Guru Arjan \nin 1606.  The Sikh movement began to get politicised \nin the seventeenth century, a development which \nculminated in the institution of the \n by Guru \nGobind Singh in 1699. The community of the Sikhs, \ncalled the \n, became a political entity. \nThe changing historical situation during the \ndevelopment of the Sikh movement. The ideas \nFig. 11\nAn early manuscript \nof the Guru Granth \nSahib.\n76\nof Baba Guru Nanak had a huge impact on this \ndevelopment from the very beginning. He emphasised \nthe importance of the worship of one God. He insisted \nthat caste, creed or gender was irrelevant for attaining \nliberation. His idea of liberation was not that of a state \nof inert bliss but rather the pursuit of active life with \na strong sense of social commitment. He himself used \nthe terms \n, \n and \n for the essence of his \nteaching, which actually meant right worship, welfare \nof others and purity of conduct. His teachings are \nnow remembered as \n, \n and \n, which also underline the importance of right \nbelief and worship, honest living, and helping others. \nThus, Baba Guru Nanak’s idea of equality had social \nand political implications. This might partly explain \nthe difference between the history of the followers of \nBaba Guru Nanak and the history of the followers of \nlike Kabir, Ravidas and Dadu, whose ideas were very \nsimilar to those of Baba Guru Nanak.\nLet’s recall\n1.

When we \nrefer to a person as a Tamil or an Oriya, this usually \nmeans that he or she speaks Tamil or Oriya and lives \nin Tamil Nadu or Orissa. We also tend to associate \neach region with distinctive kinds of food, clothes, \npoetry, dance, music and painting. Sometimes we take \nthese identities for granted and assume that they have \nexisted from time immemorial. However, the frontiers \nseparating regions have evolved over time (and in \nfact are still changing). Also, what we understand \nas regional cultures today are often the product of \ncomplex processes of intermixing of local traditions \nwith ideas from other parts of the subcontinent. As \nregions, others seem to be similar across regions, and \nyet others derive from older practices in a particular \narea, but take a new form in other regions. \nThe Cheras and the Development               \nof Malayalam \nLet us begin by looking at an example of the \nconnection between language and region. The Chera \nkingdom of Mahodayapuram was established in \nthe ninth century in the south-western part of the \npeninsula, part of the present-day Kerala. It is likely \nthat Malayalam was spoken in this area. The rulers \nintroduced the Malayalam language and script in their \ninscriptions. In fact, this is one of the earliest examples \n \nthe subcontinent. \n?\n80\n?\nFind out when the \nlanguage(s) you \nspeak at home \nwere first used \nfor writing.   \nFig. 1\nAn early Kerala \ninscription, composed \nin Malayalam.\nAt the same time, the Cheras also drew upon \nSanskritic traditions. The temple theatre of Kerala, \nwhich is traced to this period, borrowed stories \nMalayalam, dated to about the twelfth century, are \ndirectly indebted to Sanskrit.  Interestingly enough, a \nfourteenth-century text, the \ndealing with \ngrammar and poetics, was composed in Manipravalam \n– literally, “diamonds and corals” referring to the two \nlanguages, Sanskrit and the regional language.   \nRulers and Religious Traditions:              \nThe Jagannatha Cult\nIn other regions, regional cultures grew around \nreligious traditions. The best example of this \nprocess is the cult of Jagannatha (literally, lord of \nthe world, a name for Vishnu) at Puri, Orissa. To \ndate, the local tribal people make \nthe wooden image of the deity, which \nsuggests that the deity was originally \nwith Vishnu.\nIn the twelfth century, one of the \nmost important rulers of the Ganga \ndynasty, Anantavarman, decided \nto erect a temple for Purushottama \nJagannatha at Puri. Subsequently, in \n1230, king Anangabhima III dedicated \nhis kingdom to the deity and proclaimed \nhimself as the “deputy” of the god.\nFig. 2\nThe icons of \nBalabhadra, \nSubhadra and \nJagannatha, palm-leaf \nmanuscript, Orissa.\n81\nTHE MAKING OF  \nREGIONAL CULTURES\nAs the temple gained in \nimportance as a centre of \npilgrimage, its authority in \nsocial and political matters \nalso increased. All those who \nconquered Orissa, such as \nthe Mughals, the Marathas \nand the English East India \nCompany, attempted to gain \ncontrol over the temple. They felt \nthat this would make their rule \nacceptable to the local people.  \nThe Rajputs and \nTraditions of Heroism\nIn the nineteenth century, the \nregion that constitutes most \nof present-day Rajasthan, \nwas called Rajputana by the British. While this may \nsuggest that this was an area that was inhabited \nonly or mainly by Rajputs, this is only partly true. \nThere were (and are) several groups who identify \nthemselves as Rajputs in many areas of northern \nand central India. And of course, there are several \npeoples other than Rajputs who live in \nRajasthan. However, the Rajputs are often \nrecognised as contributing to the distinctive  \nculture of Rajasthan. \nThese cultural traditions were closely linked \nwith the ideals and aspirations of rulers. \nFrom about the eighth century, most of the \npresent-day state of Rajasthan was ruled by \nvarious Rajput families. Prithviraj (Chapter 2) \nwas one such ruler. These rulers cherished \nthe ideal of the hero who fought valiantly, \nthan face defeat. Stories about Rajput heroes \nwere recorded in poems and songs, which \nwere recited by specially trained minstrels. \nFig. 3\nJagannatha temple, \nPuri.\nFig. 4\nPrince Raj Singh of \nBikaner.\n82\nThese preserved the memories of heroes and were \nexpected to inspire others to follow their example. \nOrdinary people were also attracted by these stories \n– which often depicted dramatic situations, and a \nrange of strong emotions – loyalty, friendship, love, \nvalour, anger, etc. \nDid women find a place within these stories? \nSometimes women are depicted as following their \nheroic husbands in both life and death – there are \nstories about the practice of \nor the immolation \nof widows on the funeral pyre of their husbands. So \nthose who followed the heroic ideal often had to pay \nfor it with their lives. \nMap 1\nRegions discussed in \nthis chapter.\n83\nTHE MAKING OF  \nREGIONAL CULTURES\nBeyond Regional Frontiers:               \nThe Story of Kathak \nIf heroic traditions can be found in different regions in \ndifferent forms, the same is true of dance. Let us look at \nthe history of one dance form, Kathak now associated \nwith several parts of north India. The term \n \nis derived from \n, a word used in Sanskrit and \nother languages for story. The \n were originally \na caste of story-tellers in temples of north India, who \nembellished their performances with gestures and \nsongs. Kathak began evolving into a distinct mode of \nthe spread of the bhakti movement. The legends of \nRadha-Krishna were enacted in folk plays called r\n, which combined folk dance with the basic gestures \nof the \n story-tellers.\nUnder the Mughal emperors and their nobles, Kathak \nwas performed in the court, where it acquired its present \nfeatures and developed into a form of dance with a \ndistinctive style. Subsequently, it developed in two \ntraditions or \n: one in the courts of Rajasthan \n(Jaipur) and the other in Lucknow Under the patronage \nof Wajid Ali Shah, the last Nawab of Awadh, it grew into \na major art form. By the third quarter of the nineteenth \nonly in these two regions, but in the adjoining areas of \npresent-day Punjab, Haryana, Jammu and Kashmir, \nFind out whether \nthere are \ntraditions of \nheroes/heroines \nin your town or \nvillage. What \nare the qualities \nassociated with \nthem?

Emphasis was laid on \nintricate and rapid footwork, elaborate costumes, as \nwell as on the enactment of stories. \nKathak, like several other cultural practices, was \nviewed with disfavour by most British administrators \nin the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. However, it \nsurvived and continued to be performed by courtesans, \nand was recognised as one of the six “classical” forms \nof dance in the country after independence. \n?\nFind out more about any one of these dance forms. \nFig. 6\nKathak dancers, a court painting.\n“Classical” dances\nThe question of defining any art form as “classical” \nis often quite complicated. Do we define something \nas classical if it deals with a religious theme? Or do \nwe consider it classical because it appears to require \na great deal of skill acquired through long years of \ntraining? Or is it classical because it is performed \naccording to rules that are laid down, and variations \nare not encouraged? These are questions we need to \nthink about. It is worth remembering that many dance \nforms that are classified as “folk” also share several \nof the characteristics considered \ntypical of “classical” forms. So, \nwhile the use of the term \n“classical” may suggest \nthat these forms are \nsuperior, this need not \nalways be literally true. \nOther dance forms \nthat are recognised as \nclassical at present are:\nBharatanatyam \n(Tamil Nadu)\nKathakali (Kerala)\nOdissi (Odisha)\nKuchipudi (Andhra \nPradesh)\nManipuri (Manipur) \nCLASSICAL \n85\nTHE MAKING OF  \nREGIONAL CULTURES\nPainting for Patrons: The Tradition            \nof Miniatures\nAnother tradition that developed in different ways was \nthat of miniature painting. Miniatures (as their very \nname suggests) are small-sized paintings, generally \ndone in water colour on cloth or paper. The earliest \nminiatures were on palm leaves or wood. Some of the \nmost beautiful of these, found in western India, were \nused to illustrate Jaina texts. The Mughal emperors \nAkbar, Jahangir and Shah Jahan patronised highly \nskilled painters who primarily illustrated manuscripts \ncontaining historical accounts and poetry. These were \ngenerally painted in brilliant colours and portrayed \ncourt scenes, scenes of battle or hunting, and other \naspects of social life. They were often \nexchanged as gifts and were viewed \nonly by an exclusive few – the emperor \nand his close associates.\nWith the decline of the Mughal \nEmpire, many painters moved \nout to the courts of the emerging \nregional states (see also Chapter 8). \nAs a result Mughal artistic tastes \ninfluenced the regional courts of \nthe Deccan and the Rajput courts \nof Rajasthan. At the same time, \nthey retained and developed their \ndistinctive characteristics. Portraits \nof rulers and court scenes came to \nbe painted, following the Mughal \nexample. Besides, themes from \nmythology and poetry were depicted \nat centres such as Mewar, Jodhpur, \nBundi, Kota and Kishangarh. \nAnother region that attracted \nminiature paintings was the \nHimalayan foothills around the \nmodern-day state of Himachal \nPradesh. By the late seventeenth \nFig. 7\nAkbar resting \nduring a hunt, \nMughal miniature.\n86\ncentury, this region had developed a bold and intense \nstyle of miniature painting called Basohli. The most \npopular text to be painted here was Bhanudatta’s \n. Nadir Shah’s invasion and the conquest \nof Delhi in 1739 resulted in the migration of Mughal \nartists to the hills to escape the uncertainties of the \nplains. Here they found ready patrons which led to \nthe founding of the Kangra school of painting. By the \nmid-eighteenth century the Kangra artists developed \na style which breathed a new spirit into miniature \npainting. The source \nof inspiration was the \nVaishnavite traditions. \nSoft colours including \ncool blues and greens, \nand a lyrical treatment \nof themes distinguished \nKangra painting.           \nR e m e m b e r  t h a t \nordinary women and \nmen painted as well — on \n \nworks of art that have \nFig. 8\nMaharana Ram \nSingh II playing holi. \nRajput miniature, \nKota.\nFig. 9\nKrishna, Radha and \nher companion, Pahari \nminiature, Kangra.\n87\nTHE MAKING OF  \nREGIONAL CULTURES\noccasionally survived, unlike the miniatures that were \ncarefully preserved in palaces for centuries. \nA Closer Look:  Bengal \nThe Growth of a Regional Language\nAs we saw at the outset, we often tend to identify regions \nin terms of the language spoken by the people. So, we \nassume that people in Bengal always spoke Bengali. \nHowever, what is interesting is that while Bengali is \nnow recognised as a language derived from Sanskrit, \nBCE) suggest \nthat the people of Bengal did not speak Sanskritic  \nlanguages. How, then, did the new language emerge? \nFrom the fourth-third centuries BCE, commercial ties \nbegan to develop between Bengal and Magadha (south \nof Sanskrit. During the fourth century, the Gupta \nrulers established political control over north Bengal \nand began to settle Brahmanas in this area. Thus, the \nvalley became stronger. In the seventh century, the \nChinese traveller Xuan Zang observed that languages \nrelated to Sanskrit were in use all over Bengal. \nFrom the eighth century, Bengal became the centre \nof a regional kingdom under the Palas (Chapter 2). \nBetween the fourteenth and sixteenth centuries, \nBengal was ruled by Sultans who were independent of \nthe rulers in Delhi (Chapter 3). In 1586, when Akbar \nFig. 10\nA page from a \npalm-leaf manuscript \nof the earliest Bengali \nRamayana.\n88\nconquered Bengal, it formed the nucleus of the Bengal \nWhile Persian was the language of administration, \nBengali developed as a regional language. \nof dialects came to be united by a common literary \nlanguage based on the spoken language of the western \npart of the region, now known as West Bengal. \nThus, although Bengali is derived from Sanskrit, it \npassed through several stages of evolution. Also, a \nwide range of non-Sanskrit words, derived from a \nvariety of sources including tribal languages, Persian, \nand European languages, have become a part of  \nmodern Bengali. \nEarly Bengali literature may be divided into two \ncategories – one indebted to Sanskrit and the other \nSanskrit epics, the Mangalakavyas (literally auspicious \npoems, dealing with local deities) and bhakti literature, \nsuch as the biographies of Chaitanyadeva, the leader \nof the Vaishnava bhakti movement (Chapter 6). \nThe second includes Nath literature, such as \nthe songs of Maynamati and Gopichandra, stories \nconcerning the worship of Dharma Thakur, and fairy \ntales, folk tales and ballads. \nMaynamati, Gopichandra and                  \nDharma Thakur \nThe Naths were ascetics who engaged in a variety of \nyogic practices. \nThis particular song, which was often enacted, \ndescribed how Maynamati, a queen, encouraged her \nson Gopichandra to adopt the path of asceticism in the \nface of a variety of obstacles. \nDharma Thakur is a popular regional deity, often \nworshipped in the form of a stone or a piece of wood.\nto date, as several manuscripts have been found \nindicating that they were composed between the \n89\nTHE MAKING OF  \nREGIONAL CULTURES\nPir\nAnimism\nWhy do you \nthink the second \ncategory of texts \nwas not written \ndown? \n?\nbelonging to the second category circulated orally \nand cannot be precisely dated. They were particularly \nBrahmanas was relatively weak.\nPirs and Temples\nFrom the sixteenth century, people began to migrate \nin large numbers from the less fertile western Bengal \nto the forested and marshy areas of south-eastern \nBengal. As they moved eastwards, they cleared \nforests and brought the land under rice cultivation. \nGradually, local communities of fisherfolk and \nshifting cultivators, often tribals, merged with the \nnew communities of peasants. \nThis coincided with the establishment of Mughal \ncontrol over Bengal with their capital in the heart of \nreceived land and often set up mosques that served \nas centres for religious transformation in these areas.  \nThe early settlers sought some order and assurance \nin the unstable conditions of the new settlements. \nThese were provided by community leaders, who also \nfunctioned as teachers and adjudicators and were \nsometimes ascribed with supernatural powers. People \nreferred to them with affection and respect as\n.\nThis term included saints or Sufis and other \nsoldiers, various Hindu and Buddhist deities and even \nanimistic spirits. The cult of \n became very popular \nand their shrines can be found everywhere in Bengal.  \nBengal also witnessed a temple-building spree \nthe nineteenth century. We have seen (Chapter 2) \nthat temples and other religious structures were often \nbuilt by individuals or groups who were becoming \npowerful – to both demonstrate their power and \nproclaim their piety. Many of the modest brick  \n90\nand terracotta temples in Bengal were built with the \nsupport of several “low” social groups, such as the \nKolu (oil pressers) and the Kansari (bell metal workers). \nThe coming of the European trading companies created \nnew economic opportunities; many families belonging \nto these social groups availed of these. As their social \nand economic position improved, they proclaimed \ntheir status through the construction of temples. \nWhen local deities, once worshipped in thatched huts \nin villages, gained the recognition of the Brahmanas, \ntheir images began to be housed in temples. The \ntemples began to copy the double-roofed (\n) or \nfour-roofed (\n) structure of the thatched huts. \nThis led to the evolution of the typical Bengali style in  \ntemple architecture. \nIn the comparatively more complex four-roofed \nstructure, four triangular roofs placed on the four \nwalls move up to converge on a curved line or a point. \nTemples were usually built on a square platform. The \ninterior was relatively plain, but the outer walls of many \ntemples were decorated with paintings, ornamental \ntiles or terracotta tablets. In some temples, particularly \nin Vishnupur in the Bankura district of West Bengal, \nsuch decorations reached a high degree of excellence. \nCompare the \ntemple shown \nhere with that in \nChapter 2. \n?\nFig. 11 (left)\nA double-roofed \nthatched hut.\nFig. 12 (right)\nA four-roofed temple \nwith a tower.\n91\nTHE MAKING OF  \nREGIONAL CULTURES\nFish as Food \nTraditional food habits are generally based \non locally available items of food.

These were caused by a number of factors. \nEmperor Aurangzeb had depleted the military and \nfinancial resources of his empire by fighting a long \nwar in the Deccan. \nUnder his successors, the efficiency of the imperial \nadministration broke down. It became increasingly \ndifficult for the later Mughal emperors to keep a check \non their powerful mansabdars. Nobles appointed \nas governors (subadars) often controlled the offices \n?\nSee Chapter 4, \nTable 1.

This gave them extraordinary political, \neconomic and military powers over vast regions of the \nMughal Empire. As the governors consolidated their \ncontrol over the provinces, the periodic remission of \nrevenue to the capital declined.\nPeasant and zamindari rebellions in many parts of \nnorthern and western India added to these problems. \nThese revolts were sometimes caused by the pressures \nof mounting taxes. At other times they were attempts \nby powerful chieftains to consolidate their own \npositions. Mughal authority had been challenged by \nrebellious groups in the past as well. But these groups \nwere now able to seize the economic resources of the \nregion to consolidate their positions. The Mughal \nemperors after Aurangzeb were unable to arrest the \ngradual shifting of political and economic authority \ninto the hands of provincial governors, local chieftains \nand other groups. \nRich harvests and empty coffers \nThe following is a contemporary writer’s account of the \nfinancial bankruptcy of the empire: \nThe great lords are helpless and impoverished. Their peasants \nraise two crops a year, but their lords see nothing of either, and \ntheir agents on the spot are virtual prisoners in the peasants’ \nhands, like a peasant kept in his creditor’s house until he \ncan pay his debt. So complete is the collapse of all order and \nadministration that though the peasant reaps a harvest of \ngold, his lord does not see so much as a wisp of straw. How \nthen can the lord keep the armed force he should? How can \nhe pay the soldiers who should go before him when he goes \nout, or the horsemen who should ride behind him?\n \nReprint 2024-25\n97\neighteenth-century\npolitical formations\nIn the midst of this economic and political crisis, the \nruler of Iran, Nadir Shah, sacked and plundered the \ncity of Delhi in 1739 and took away immense amounts \nof wealth. This invasion was followed by a series of \nplundering raids by the Afghan ruler Ahmad Shah \nAbdali, who invaded north India five times between \n1748 and 1761.\nNadir Shah attacks Delhi\nThe devastation of Delhi after Nadir Shah’s invasion was \ndescribed by contemporary observers. One described \nthe wealth looted from the Mughal treasury as follows: \nsixty lakhs of rupees and some thousand gold coins, nearly one \ncrore worth of gold-ware, nearly fifty crores worth of jewels, \nmost of them unrivalled in the world, and the above included \nthe Peacock throne.\n Another account described the invasion’s impact \nupon Delhi: \n(those) … who had been masters were now in dire straits; \nand those who had been revered couldn’t even (get water \nto) quench their thirst. The recluses were pulled out of their \ncorners. The wealthy were turned into beggars. Those who \nonce set the style in clothes now went naked; and those \nwho owned property were now homeless … The New City \n(Shahjahanabad) was turned into rubble. (Nadir Shah) then \nattacked the Old quarters of the city and destroyed a whole \nworld that existed there …\nFig. 1\nA 1779 portrait of Nadir \nShah.\nAlready under severe pressure from all sides, the \nempire was further weakened by competition amongst \ndifferent groups of nobles. They were divided into \ntwo major groups or factions, the Iranis and Turanis \n(nobles of Turkish descent). For a long time, the later \nMughal emperors were puppets in the hands of either \nReprint 2024-25\n98\nour pasts – ii\none or the other of these two powerful groups. \nThe worst possible humiliation came when two \nMughal emperors, Farrukh Siyar (1713 –1719) \nand Alamgir II (1754 –1759) were assassinated, \nand two others, Ahmad Shah (1748 –1754) and \nShah Alam II (1759 –1816) were blinded by  \ntheir nobles.\nWith the decline in the authority of the \nMughal emperors, the governors of large \nprovinces, subadars, and the great zamindars \nconsolidated their authority in different parts \nof the subcontinent, such as Awadh, Bengal  \nand Hyderabad. \nThe Rajputs \nMany Rajput kings, particularly those belonging to \nAmber and Jodhpur, had served under the Mughals \nwith distinction. In exchange, they were permitted to \nenjoy considerable autonomy in their watan jagirs. In \nthe eighteenth century, these rulers now attempted to \nextend their control over adjacent regions. Ajit Singh, \nthe ruler of Jodhpur, was also involved in the factional \npolitics at the Mughal court. \nThese influential Rajput families claimed the \nsubadari of the rich provinces of Gujarat and Malwa. \nRaja Ajit Singh of Jodhpur held the governorship of \nGujarat and Sawai Raja Jai Singh of Amber was the \ngovernor of Malwa. These offices were renewed by \nEmperor Jahandar Shah in 1713. They also tried to \nextend their territories by seizing portions of imperial \nterritories neighbouring their watans. Nagaur was \nconquered and annexed to the house of Jodhpur, \nwhile Amber seized large portions of Bundi. Sawai \nRaja Jai Singh founded his new capital at Jaipur \nand was given the subadari of Agra in 1722. Maratha \ncampaigns into Rajasthan from the 1740s put severe \npressure on these principalities and checked their \nfurther expansion.\nFig. 2\nFarrukh Siyar receiving \na noble in court.\nMany Rajput \nrulers had \naccepted the \nsuzerainty of \nthe Mughals but \nMewar was the \nonly Rajput state \nwhich defied \nMughal authority. \nRana Pratap \nascended the \nthrone at Mewar \nin 1572, with \nUdaipur and large \npart of Mewar \nunder his control. \nA series of envoys \nwere sent to the \nRana to persuade \nhim to accept \nMughal suzerainty,  \nbut he stood his \nground.\nReprint 2024-25\n99\neighteenth-century\npolitical formations\nRaja Jai Singh of Jaipur\nA description of Raja Jai Singh in a Persian account of \n1732: \nRaja Jai Singh was at the height of his power.

Several battles \nwere fought by Guru Gobind Singh against the Rajput \nand Mughal rulers, both before and after the institution \nof the Khalsa in 1699. After his death in 1708, the Khalsa \nrose in revolt against the Mughal authority under Banda \nBahadur’s leadership, declared their sovereign rule by \nstriking coins in the name of Guru Nanak and Guru \nGobind Singh, and established their own administration \nbetween the Sutlej and the Jamuna. Banda Bahadur \nwas captured in 1715 and executed in 1716. \nFig. 6\nSword of Maharaja \nRanjit Singh.\nWhat is the Khalsa? \nDo you recall \nreading about \nit in Chapter 6?\n?\nReprint 2024-25\n101\neighteenth-century\npolitical formations\ncentury, the Sikhs organised themselves into a \nnumber of bands called jathas, and later on misls. \nTheir combined forces were known as the grand \narmy (dal khalsa). The entire body used to meet \nat Amritsar at the time of Baisakhi and Diwali to \ntake collective decisions known as “resolutions of \nthe Guru (gurmatas)”. A system called rakhi was \nintroduced, offering protection to cultivators on the \npayment of a tax of 20 per cent of the produce. \nGuru Gobind Singh had inspired the Khalsa with \nthe belief that their destiny was to rule (raj karega \nkhalsa). Their well-knit organisation enabled them \nto put up a successful resistance to the Mughal \ngovernors first and then to Ahmad Shah Abdali who \nhad seized the rich province of the Punjab and the \nSarkar of Sirhind from the Mughals. The Khalsa \ndeclared their sovereign rule by striking their own \ncoin again in 1765. Significantly, this coin bore the \nsame inscription as the one on the orders issued by \nthe Khalsa in the time of Banda Bahadur.  \nThe Sikh territories in the late eighteenth century \nextended from the Indus to the Jamuna but they \nwere divided under different rulers. One of them, \nMaharaja Ranjit Singh, reunited these groups and \nestablished his capital at Lahore in 1799.  \nThe Marathas\nThe Maratha kingdom was established by Chhatrapati \nShivaji Maharaj (1630). The Maratha kingdom was \nanother powerful regional kingdom to arise out \nof a sustained opposition to Mughal rule. Shivaji \n(1630–1680) carved out a stable kingdom with the \nsupport of powerful warrior families (deshmukhs). \nGroups of highly mobile, peasant-pastoralists \n(kunbis) provided the backbone of the Maratha \narmy. Shivaji used these forces to challenge the \nMughals in the peninsula. After Shivaji’s death, \neffective power in the Maratha state was wielded by a \nfamily of Chitpavan Brahmanas who served Shivaji’s \nsuccessors as Peshwa (or principal minister). Poona \nbecame the capital of the Maratha kingdom.\nFig. 7\nPortrait of Shivaji\nTowards the end of the \n17th century,  \na powerful state \nstarted emerging in \nthe Deccan under the \nleadership of Shivaji \nwhich finally led to the \nestablishment of the \nMaratha state. Shivaji \nwas born to Shahji and \nJija Bai at Shivneri \nin 1630.  Under the \nguidance of his mother \nand his guardian \nDada Konddev, Shivaji \nembarked on a career \nof conquest at a young \nage. The occupation \nof Javli made him the \nundisputed leader of \nthe Mavala highlands \nwhich paved the way \nfor further expansion. \nHis exploits against \nthe forces of Bijapur \nand the Mughals \nmade him a legendary \nfigure. He often \nresorted to guerrilla \nwarfare against \nhis opponents. By \nintroducing an efficient \nadministrative system \nsupported by a revenue \ncollection method \nbased on chauth and \nsardeshmukhi, he laid \nthe foundations of a \nstrong Maratha state. \nReprint 2024-25\n102\nour pasts – ii\nUnder the Peshwas, the Marathas developed a very \nsuccessful military organisation. Their success lay \nin bypassing the fortified areas of the Mughals, by \nraiding cities and by engaging Mughal armies in areas \nwhere their supply lines and reinforcements could be \neasily disturbed. \nBetween 1720 and 1761, the Maratha empire \nexpanded. It gradually chipped away at the authority \nof the Mughal Empire. Malwa and Gujarat were seized \nfrom the Mughals by the 1720s. By the 1730s, the \nMaratha king was recognised as the overlord of the \nentire Deccan peninsula. He possessed the right to \nlevy chauth and sardeshmukhi in the entire region.  \nAfter raiding Delhi in 1737, the frontiers of Maratha \ndomination expanded rapidly: into Rajasthan and the \nPunjab in the north; into Bengal and Orissa in the \neast; and into Karnataka and the Tamil and Telugu \ncountries in the South (see Map 1). These were not \nformally included in the Maratha empire, but were \nmade to pay tribute as a way of accepting Maratha \nsovereignty. Expansion brought enormous resources, \nbut it came at a price. These military campaigns also \nmade other rulers hostile towards the Marathas. As a \nresult, they were not inclined to support the Marathas \nduring the third battle of Panipat in 1761.\nAlongside endless military campaigns, the Marathas \ndeveloped an effective administrative system as well. \nOnce conquest had been completed and Maratha rule \nwas secure, revenue demands were gradually introduced \ntaking local conditions into account. Agriculture was \nencouraged and trade revived. This allowed Maratha \nchiefs (sardars) like Sindhia of Gwalior, Gaekwad of \nBaroda and Bhonsle of Nagpur the resources to raise \npowerful armies. Maratha campaigns into Malwa in \nthe 1720s did not challenge the growth and prosperity \nof the cities in the region. Ujjain expanded under \nSindhia’s patronage and Indore under Holkar’s. By \nall accounts, these cities were large and prosperous \nand functioned as important commercial and cultural \ncentres. New trade routes emerged within the areas \ncontrolled by the Marathas.
